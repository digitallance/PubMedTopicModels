PURPOSE: To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of collagenase Clostridium
histolyticum to treat thumb and first web contractures in Dupuytren disease.
METHODS: We prospectively included 14 thumbs in 12 patients with a contracture at
the metacarpophalangeal or interphalangeal joint of at least 20° with a palpable 
cord in the thumb (n = 8) or an adduction contracture of the thumb with palpable 
cords in the first web (n = 6). They received an injection containing 0.58 mg of 
collagenase Clostridium histolyticum in the fibrous cord divided over 3 spots.
The contracture was released by carefully manipulating the thumb under local
anesthesia 1 day later. The extension and abduction deficits were measured before
and after the intervention (follow-up at 7 and 30 days and 6 months). Wilcoxon
signed rank test was used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: In the total sample, postintervention extension deficits were
statistically significantly lower than preintervention deficits except in one
patient who had a recurrence at 6 months compared with the 30-day posttreatment
result. Intermetacarpophalangeal head distance (IMD) also improved significantly.
In an analysis of subgroups, we compared the separate contributions of treatment 
of a pretendinous cord and a first web cord on both extension deficit and IMD.
Treatment of pretendinous cords significantly affected both extension deficit and
IMD. However, treatment of first web contractures did not significantly improve
extension or IMD.
CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum is a good treatment option for 
pretendinous cords in thumbs affected with Dupuytren disease because it provides 
good results, is minimally invasive, and has minor adverse events.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
