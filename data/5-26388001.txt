The literature on Dupuytren's contracture is vast yet little information is known
as to which papers have been the most influential. The purpose of this study was 
to identify the 50 most cited papers on Dupuytren's contracture and perform a
citation analysis. Utilizing the Web of Science, 23 surgical, medical, plastic
and hand surgery journals were searched for papers on Dupuytren's contracture.
Resulting articles were ranked in order of times cited and each paper was
analyzed for article-type, year of publication, country of origin, institution
and level of evidence. The 50 most cited articles represent many important
landmarks in Dupuytren's treatment and contain several seminal works by experts
in the field. Whilst the top 50 list highlights the important papers on the
condition, they certainly do not provide information about the quality of the
evidence of the research, as most papers presented level 4 or 5 evidence.
