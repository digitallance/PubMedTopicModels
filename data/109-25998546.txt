STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
INTRODUCTION: The evidence of the relationship between functional recovery and
impairment after surgery and hand therapy are inconsistent.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To explore factors that were most related to functional
recovery as measured by DASH in patients with Dupuytren's disease.
METHODS: Eighty-one patients undergoing surgery and hand therapy were
consecutively recruited. Functional recovery was measured by the Disability of
the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. Explanatory variables: range of 
motion of the finger joints, five questions regarding safety and social issues of
hand function, and health-related quality of life (Euroqol).
RESULTS: The three variables "need to take special precautions", "avoid using the
hand in social context", and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index)
explained 62.1% of the variance in DASH, where the first variable had the
greatest relative effect.
DISCUSSION: Safety and social issues of hand function and quality of life had an 
evident association with functional recovery.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.
