BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a nodular palmar fibromatosis that causes
irreversible permanent contracture of fingers and results in the loss of hand
function. Surgery still remains the only available solution for DD patients but
cannot permanently cure the disease nor reduce high recurrence rates. With this
rationale, we designed a study aimed at an improved understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying DD. Our major focus was an analysis of the global
gene expression profile and signalling pathways in DD cells with the aim of
identifying novel biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets.
METHODS: Primary cells were cultured from surgically removed diseased and healthy
tissue. Microarray expression analysis (HG-U133A array, Affymetrix) and qPCR was 
performed with total RNA isolated from primary DD cells. Mechanistic studies
involving inhibition of p38 phosphorylation were performed on normal human
fibroblasts' and primary DD cells' in vitro models. Expression of stem cell
markers in primary fibroblasts/myofibroblasts was assessed as well.
RESULTS: We identified 3 p38MAPK signalling pathway regulatory genes, THBS1,
GADD45α and NUAK1, all involved in cellular proliferation and production of the
extracellular matrix proteins. Inhibition of the p38MAPK signalling pathway
induced down-regulation of myofibroblast markers, α-smooth muscle actin and
palladin. A stem-cell like subpopulation positive for CD90 marker was identified 
among primary DD cells.
CONCLUSION: The study reveals involvement of the p38 MAPK pathway as a possible
signalling cascade in the pathogenesis of Dupuytren's disease. Moreover, a
particular stem cell-like CD90(+) subpopulation was identified that might
contribute to DD development.
