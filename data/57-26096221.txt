PURPOSE: Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren Long-Term Evaluation of
Safety Study was a 5-year noninterventional follow-up study to determine
long-term efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH)
treatment for Dupuytren contracture.
METHODS: Patients from previous CCH clinical studies were eligible. Enrolled
patients were evaluated annually for contracture and safety at 2, 3, 4, and 5
years after their first injection (0.58 mg) of CCH. In successfully treated
joints (≤ 5° contracture following CCH treatment), recurrence was defined as 20° 
or greater worsening (relative to day 30 after the last injection) with a
palpable cord or any medical/surgical intervention to correct new/worsening
contracture. A post hoc analysis was also conducted using a less stringent
threshold (≥ 30° worsening) for comparison with criteria historically used to
assess surgical treatment.
RESULTS: Of 950 eligible patients, 644 enrolled (1,081 treated joints). At year
5, 47% (291 of 623) of successfully treated joints had recurrence (≥ 20°
worsening)-39% (178 of 451) of metacarpophalangeal and 66% (113 of 172) of
proximal interphalangeal joints. At year 5, 32% (198 of 623) of successfully
treated joints had 30° or greater worsening (metacarpophalangeal 26% [119 of 451]
and proximal interphalangeal 46% [79 of 172] joints). Of 105 secondary
interventions performed in the successfully treated joints, 47% (49 of 105)
received fasciectomy, 30% (32 of 105) received additional CCH, and 23% (24 of
105) received other interventions. One mild adverse event was attributed to CCH
treatment (skin atrophy [decreased ring finger circumference from thinning of
Dupuytren tissue]). Antibodies to clostridial type I and/or II collagenase were
found in 93% of patients, but over the 5 years of follow-up, this did not
correspond to any reported clinical adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Five years after successful CCH treatment, the overall recurrence
rate of 47% was comparable with published recurrence rates after surgical
treatments, with one reported long-term treatment-related adverse event.
Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection proved to be an effective and safe
treatment for Dupuytren contracture. For those receiving treatment during
follow-up, both CCH and fasciectomy were elected options.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.
