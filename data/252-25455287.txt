INTRODUCTION: We integrated two factors, demographic population shifts and
changes in prevalence of disease, to predict future trends in demand for hand
surgery in England, to facilitate workforce planning.
METHODS: We analysed Hospital Episode Statistics data for Dupuytren's disease,
carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, and trigger finger from 1998 to 
2011. Using linear regression, we estimated trends in both diagnosis and surgery 
until 2030. We integrated this regression with age specific population data from 
the Office for National Statistics in order to estimate how this will contribute 
to a change in workload over time.
RESULTS: There has been a significant increase in both absolute numbers of
diagnoses and surgery for all four conditions. Combined with future population
data, we calculate that the total operative burden for these four conditions will
increase from 87,582 in 2011 to 170,166 (95% confidence interval 144,517-195,353)
in 2030.
DISCUSSION: The prevalence of these diseases in the ageing population, and
increasing prevalence of predisposing factors such as obesity and diabetes, may
account for the predicted increase in workload. The most cost effective
treatments must be sought, which requires high quality clinical trials. Our
methodology can be applied to other sub-specialties to help anticipate the need
for future service provision.
