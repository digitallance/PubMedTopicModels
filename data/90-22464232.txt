PURPOSE: To critically review the efficacy, recurrence rate, and complications of
needle aponeurotomy (NA) for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of the results of NA for the treatment of
Dupuytren contracture. We included in the study all patients who had NA performed
for metacarpophalangeal (MP) or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture 
of 20° or greater between March 2005 and May 2008. There were 474 patients with
1,013 fingers treated. The average age was 62 years (range, 33-92 y).
Pre-procedure MP joint contracture averaged 35° (range, 15° to 95°), and PIP
joint 50° (range, 15° to 110°). Immediately postprocedure and at least 3 years
after treatment (range, 3.0-6.2 y), we measured MP and PIP joint contractures and
reviewed records for complications.
RESULTS: MP joint contractures were corrected an average of 99% and PIP
contractures an average of 89% immediately postprocedure. At final follow-up, 72%
of the correction was maintained for MP joints and 31% for PIP joints. The
difference between the final corrections for MP versus PIP joints was
statistically significant. When we compared the final results of patients age 55 
years and older versus under 55 years, we found a statistically significant
difference at both MP and PIP joints, with greater correction maintained in the
older group. Gender differences were not statistically significant. Needle
aponeurotomy provided successful correction to 5° or less contracture immediately
postprocedure in 98% (791) of MP joints and 67% (350) of PIP joints. There was
recurrence of 20° or less over the original postprocedure corrected level in 80% 
(646) of MP joints and 35% (183) of PIP joints. Complications were rare except
for skin tears, which occurred in 3.4% (34) of digits.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that NA is a safe procedure that can be performed
in an outpatient setting. The complication rate was low, but recurrences were
frequent in younger patients and for PIP contractures.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
