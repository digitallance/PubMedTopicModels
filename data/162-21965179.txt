Post-surgical outcomes in patients with Dupuytren's disease causing flexion
contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint can be inconsistent and are
often associated with protracted rehabilitation, reduced flexion, recurrence of
the contracture, and patient dissatisfaction. An alternative treatment option,
comprised of splinting and soft tissue mobilization techniques, was introduced to
stabilize early contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joint in the hopes
of delaying or obviating surgery. Over the course of approximately 12.6 months (±
7.8), thirteen patients were followed at the hand clinic at Hotel Dieu Hospital
in Kingston. One patient was unable to complete the course of therapy. Of the
remaining patients, analysis showed significant improvement in active proximal
interphalangeal joint extension of approximately 14.6° (SD: ± 5.1°; range: 5-25°)
over the course of the treatment (p < .05). Nighttime static extension splinting 
and soft tissue mobilization techniques appear to delay and possibly prevent the 
need for surgery in individuals with flexion contractures of the proximal
interphalangeal joint due to Dupuytren's disease.
