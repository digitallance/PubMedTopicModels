OBJECTIVE: : To evaluate and compare the behavior of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in
Dupuytren disease (DD).
METHODS: : This is an experimental study with 23 patients diagnosed with DD.
Tissue collected through fasciectomy with incision type Brunner or McCash were
evaluated by electrophoresis for identification of GAGs. The quantification was
carried out by immunofluorescence and dosage of proteins for different types of
glycosaminoglycans. The results were expressed in percentage and statistically
evaluated.
RESULTS: : A significant increase was observed through eletrophoresis in GAGs, as
compared to the control (p<0.05). Immunofluorescence of hyaluronic acid was
reduced (23 times) when compared to the control (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: : An increase of sulfated GAGs in Dupuytren's disease, mainly
dermatan sulfate, was evident from our results, as well as a pronounced decrease 
of hyaluronic acid in the palmar aponeurosis from the same patients. Level of
Evidence III, Case-Control Study.
