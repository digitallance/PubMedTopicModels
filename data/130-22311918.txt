Before surgery for Dupuytren's contracture, 54 patients with a proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joint flexion contractures of at least 30° were randomized 
to receive either a 3-month splinting protocol together with hand therapy under
the direct supervision of hand therapists, or the same hand therapy alone.
Extension deficit of the PIP joint (primary outcome measure), global perceived
effect, pain intensity, comfort and complications were assessed at baseline and 1
year after surgery. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the group assigned to
splint-plus-hand therapy had a mean reduction of 21° in flexion contracture after
1 year, compared with 29° in the group receiving hand therapy alone (p = 0.1).
There was no difference between the groups regarding other parameters. After
operative release of a Dupuytren's contracture, a postoperative protocol using a 
splint and hand therapy was no better than hand therapy alone in minimizing
postoperative flexion contractures.
