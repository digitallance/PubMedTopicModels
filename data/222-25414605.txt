PURPOSE: Open fasciectomy represents a standard treatment of Dupuytren's disease.
Although patients are commonly immobilized in extension to prevent postoperative 
contracture formation, immobilizing the extremity under tension may precipitate a
flare reaction and scar-related complications. This study explores the incidence 
of flare reaction and other complications with postoperative tension-free
splinting after fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients' charts that consisted of 228
procedures in 191 patients who underwent surgery by the senior author between
2000 and 2010. Postoperative notes were reviewed for wound healing problems, scar
appearance, flare reaction, and complications. The grading system defined by
Evans et al. was used to standardize flare reaction and scar complications.
RESULTS: Using tension-free splinting, the incidence of flare reaction was 3.5Â % 
(8/228). The eight patients that had flare reactions had mild involvement, and no
severe reaction was observed. Fifteen patients had hypertrophic scars, eight had 
hypersensitive scars, and six had recurrent contractures.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of flare reaction using tension-free immobilization
postoperatively was low in our study. According to our findings, wound healing
problems are rare when tensionless splinting is utilized. Type of study/level of 
evidence Case series, Level IV, Therapeutic study.
