Dupuytren's disease is a connective tissue disorder of the hand causing excessive
palmar fascial fibrosis with associated finger contracture and disability. The
aetiology of the disease is heterogeneous, with both genetic and environmental
components. The connective tissue is abnormally infiltrated by myofibroblasts
that deposit collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. We describe the
clinical profile of Dupuytren's disease along with current therapeutic schemes.
Recent findings on molecular and cellular parameters that are dysregulated in
Dupuytren's disease, which may contribute to the onset of the disease, and the
role of resident inflammation promoting fibrosis, are highlighted. We review
recent literature focusing on non-myofibroblast cell types (stem cell-like
cells), their pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic role that may account for
abnormal wound healing response.
