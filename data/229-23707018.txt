PURPOSE: To explore the impact of Dupuytren disease (DD) from the patients'
perspective.
METHODS: Audio-recorded interviews were conducted for patients with Dupuytren
disease (DD) attending outpatient clinics. The interviews were transcribed and
subjected to content analysis. This analysis highlighted key impact areas and
common themes in individuals' personal experiences. These were then allocated to 
categories specified by the World Health Organization International
Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (impairments and activity
limitations) and the needs-based model of quality of life (QoL).
RESULTS: Qualitative unstructured interviews were conducted with 34 patients (74%
men; age, 41-80 y; mean [SD], 64 [13] y). The sample had a wide range of severity
and duration of DD (range, 0.5-40; mean [SD], 13 [10] y). Nine hundred
fifty-three statements relating to the impact of DD were identified from the
interview transcripts. These statements fell into 2 major categories of impact:
activity limitations (10 themes including problems with dressing, gripping, and
personal care) and QoL (6 need categories: physiological, safety and security,
social, affection, esteem, and cognitive needs).
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the interviews suggest that DD affects both
performance of activities and QoL. To determine accurately the effectiveness of
DD interventions from the patients' perspective, it is important to determine
their impacts on both activity limitations and QoL. We intend to develop valid,
reproducible, and responsive DD-specific scales for this purpose.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The study identifies key issues specific to DD that influence
patients' functioning and QoL. The information reported will form the basis of
DD-specific patient-reported outcomes measures for use in clinical practice and
evaluations of interventions.
