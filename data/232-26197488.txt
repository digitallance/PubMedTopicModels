OBJECTIVE: Joint stiffness is a common, debilitating, age-related symptom, which 
may be seen after total joint replacement (TJR). Stiffness also occurs in
fibrotic conditions such as shoulder capsulitis and Dupuytren's contracture. We
speculated that the two traits (TJR and fibrotic disease) are linked
pathogenically.
METHODS: Using the TwinsUK NIHR BRC BioResource we tested the hypotheses that 1) 
joint (hip and knee) stiffness, TJR (hip and knee), and fibrotic conditions are
associated and 2) genetic factors contribute to them.
RESULTS: Participating twins (n = 9718) had completed self-reported
questionnaires on the traits of interest. All three traits were significantly
associated with increasing age and body mass index (BMI), as well as female sex, 
on univariate analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed a
significant association between TJR and joint stiffness (OR = 3.96, 95%
confidence interval, CI 2.77-5.68) and between fibrotic conditions and joint
stiffness (OR = 2.39, 1.74-3.29), adjusting for age, sex, BMI and twin
relatedness. Monozygotic versus dizygotic intraclass correlations gave
heritability estimates for TJR = 46% and joint stiffness = 32%.
CONCLUSION: That fibrotic conditions, joint stiffness and TJR are significantly
associated suggests a common disease process, possibly fibrosis, which is
genetically mediated.
