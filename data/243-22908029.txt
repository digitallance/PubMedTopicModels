OBJECTIVES: To detail the transition to a totally one-stop wide-awake (OSWA)
Dupuytren's contracture surgical service.
DESIGN: Retrospective review of Dupuytren's component of last 1000 OSWA cases.
SETTING: The UK's first totally one-stop wide-awake orthopaedic service.
PARTICIPANTS: 270 patients with Dupuytren's contracture out of the last 1000 OSWA
cases.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical outcomes, patient satisfaction and
cost-effectiveness and efficiency.
RESULTS: The OSWA Dupuytren's model is safe, efficient and effective; with a low 
complication rate, extremely high patient satisfaction; and cost-savings to the
nhs of £2500 per case treated. The service saved the NHS approximately £675,000
for the 270 cases presented.
CONCLUSIONS: A totally one-stop wide-awake Dupuytren's Contracture service is
practicable and feasible alternative to the conventional treatment pathway, with 
benefits in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
