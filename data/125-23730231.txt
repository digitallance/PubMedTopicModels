BACKGROUND: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is a Food and Drug
Administration-approved treatment for adult patients with Dupuytren's contracture
with a palpable cord that has been shown efficacious and safe in clinical trials.
METHODS: This paper summarizes the most common post-marketing clinical adverse
event (AE) reports received by the manufacturer of CCH and sponsor of the US
Biologics License Application (Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Malvern, PA, USA) during
the first 12 months after drug approval and commercialization in the USA.
RESULTS: Of the 115 AE reports describing 270 AEs voluntarily received from
patients or health care providers after approximately 5,400 injections of CCH
administered, the most common AEs involved local, nonserious reactions to
treatment, including skin tears, peripheral edema, and contusion. There were few 
serious AEs observed (0.6% reporting rate per 1,000 injections), and two flexor
tendon ruptures and one flexor pulley injury were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of post-marketing AEs received for CCH in the first year
post-approval supports the safety profile reported earlier during clinical
development and did not reveal additional clinical risks or concerns about CCH.
