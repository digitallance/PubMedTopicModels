The authors describe the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian man with psoriasis who
subsequently developed psoriatic arthritis, gout and Dupuytren's contracture.
This is the first report documenting the simultaneous occurrence of psoriasis,
psoriatic arthritis, gout and Dupuytren's contracture in a single patient. The
etiopathology underlying the concurrent presence of these diseases is discussed.
