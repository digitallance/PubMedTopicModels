BACKGROUND: This study examined the efficacy, complications, and contracture
recurrence in patients who received injectable collagenase clostridium
histolyticum (CCH) for Dupuytren's-induced metacarpophalangeal (MP) and proximal 
interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review at one center compared the degree of MP and
PIP joint contracture pre-injection, post-cord rupture, and at final follow-up
after a minimum duration of 6 months. Recurrence was defined as a 20 ° or greater
increase in contracture above the minimum value achieved.
RESULTS: Of 102 eligible patients, 48 patients (47 %) (31 males, 17 females) were
available for review. 53 digits and 64 joints (46 MP joints and 18 PIP joints)
were studied. The mean patient age was 66 years (range, 48-87 years) and mean
follow-up duration was 15 months (range, 6 to 25 months). The mean MP joint
contracture was 51 ± 20 ° at baseline, 4 ± 8 ° post-cord rupture, and 9 ± 15 ° at
latest follow-up. The mean PIP joint contracture was 39 ± 23 ° at baseline,
14 ± 14 ° at cord rupture, and 29 ± 20 ° at latest follow-up. Of the 46 MP joints
and 18 PIP joints, 11 MP (24 %) and 7 (39 %) PIP joints met the recurrence
criteria. Of 102 patients, 1 patient had a small finger flexor tendon rupture.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the dramatic initial reduction in contracture, recurrence
developed in a high proportion of patients over the study period. While initially
effective, CCH may not provide durable contracture reduction. However, CCH
remains a viable nonsurgical treatment for Dupuytren's disease.
