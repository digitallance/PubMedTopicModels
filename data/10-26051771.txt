BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the degree of contracture in the ring and
little fingers at which hand function became importantly impaired.
METHODS: Five activities of daily living were incorporated into a newly developed
and validated Dupuytren's assessment tool (DAT). Sixty healthy participants were 
assessed with the DAT wearing a range of 12 dorsal blocking splints. Half wore
them on their right little finger, the other half on their ring finger. These
induced flexion deformities mimicking DC of the MCPJ, PIPJ and a combination of
the two. The angles of flexion deformity at which important hand disability
occurred were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: Clinically important hand disability occurred for the little finger
MCPJ, PIPJ and combined MCPJ and PIPJ angulation at 52.5, 67.5, and 75 degrees
respectively. For the ring finger joint, the angulations were 52.5, 67.5 and 75
degrees respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This information will provide information for clinicians and
patients as to when clinically important disability tends to occur in DC.
