Treatment options for the Dupuytren contractures vary from percutaneous needle
aponeurotomy, open fasciotomy or fasciectomy, dermofasciectomy, and more
recently, injectable collagenase. Although utilization of injectable collagenase 
avoids a formal surgical procedure, not all patients are eligible and some
patients do not feel comfortable with an enzyme injection or the associated
risks, which may include hematoma, wound dehiscence, or tendon rupture. This
study describes the technique and early results of partial fasciectomy through a 
mini-incision approach as an additional treatment option for Dupuytren
contractures. We found that this procedure results in contracture correction with
a low rate of complications and thus provides the surgeon with an alternative
treatment option to offer patients.
