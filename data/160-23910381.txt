PURPOSE: To study the evolution of deformity of the proximal interphalangeal
joint over 5 years after good surgical correction of Dupuytren-induced
contracture.
METHODS: We assessed 63 patients (72 fingers; 69 hands) with Dupuytren disease
for the degree of contracture, its correction after surgery, and the range of
movement at the proximal interphalangeal joints at 3 and 6 months, and 1, 3, and 
5 years after fasciectomy with or without the use of a firebreak graft. We
investigated associations between the recurrence of contracture and preoperative 
patient and surgical factors.
RESULTS: There were 4 patterns of evolution of contracture after surgical
correction. A total of 31 patients (33 hands) showed good improvement that was
maintained for 5 years (minimal recontracture group). Twenty patients (23 hands) 
showed good initial improvement, which mildly worsened (< 20°) but was then
maintained over 5 years (mild early recontracture group). Four patients (5 hands)
worsened in first 3 months after surgery (> 20°) but there was no further
worsening (severe early recontracture group). Eight patients (8 hands) worsened
progressively over 5 years (progressive recontracture group). Worsening of
contracture more than 6° between 3 and 6 months after surgery predicted
progressive recontracture at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence of contracture (not disease recurrence) could be
predicted as early as 6 months after surgery for Dupuytren disease.
