Dupuytren contracture of the palm is a relatively common benign
fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia typically affecting the adult
population. There have however been several reported cases of Dupuytren
contracture in children. We sought to review the literature for Dupuytren
contracture and highlight the main clinical features and management of the
disease in children.
