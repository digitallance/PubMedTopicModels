INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the enzyme collagenase has been developed for the 
percutaneous treatment of Dupuytren's contracture, allowing management of the
condition as an outpatient. We present early results on the treatment of
Dupuytren's contracture using injectable collagenase.
METHODS: Patients awaiting Fasciectomy for Dupuytren's Contracture were selected 
for enrolment. Contracture cords were then marked and injected with collagenase
in the outpatients department. Twenty-four hours later, patients returned for an 
extension procedure, performed under regional anaesthesia. Hand therapy was then 
commenced as for surgical release. Contracture angles were measured pre-injection
and at follow-up.
RESULTS: Thirteen fingers were treated in 10 patients with a mean age of 66
years. Eight little fingers and five ring fingers were treated. Four fingers had 
isolated metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ) contracture, one finger had isolated
proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) contracture and the remainder had combined 
contractures. Mean pre-treatment MCPJ contracture was 58.6째 and the mean
pre-treatment PIPJ contracture was 39째. Post-treatment contracture was 4.23째 and 
9째 for the MCPJ and PIPJ, respectively. All patients were satisfied with their
results.
COMPLICATIONS: Significant post-injection bruising occured in one patient. Skin
tears occurred in 11 digits, and in all cases healed without intervention. No
tendon rupture occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase is a safe and effective outpatient-based treatment for
Dupuytren's contracture, which may be useful in controlling surgical waiting
lists. We recommend its use as first-line treatment in patients who are
unsuitable more invasive treatment alternatives.
