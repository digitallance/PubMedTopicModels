We describe technical tips for injecting collagenase into Dupuytren cords based
on experience acquired during the prerelease Food and Drug Administration
clinical trials and with subsequent clinical practice. These tips include
techniques for extracting the reconstituted enzyme efficiently from the vial,
injecting the cord(s) with increased safety to the tendons, and anesthetizing the
hand before manipulation. The tips are intended to supplement but by no means
replace the manufacturer's prescribing information and training video.
