BACKGROUND: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum was approved for clinical use in
2010 and has become an accepted treatment modality for Dupuytren's contracture.
Because longitudinal experience with injectable collagenase remains limited, the 
effect of treatment on future surgery is not well defined.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the senior author's practice from February of 
2010 through March of 2014 was performed. Eleven patients were identified who had
digital or palmar fasciectomy after at least one previous injection of
collagenase clostridium histolyticum. Cases were reviewed for functional outcomes
and operative difficulty.
RESULTS: Seven metacarpophalangeal joints and 12 proximal interphalangeal joints 
in 11 patients were treated. Nine of the 11 patients were referred to the senior 
author after collagenase clostridium histolyticum injections by other hand
surgeons; two patients had previous injections by the senior author. The average 
interval between most recent injection and salvage fasciectomy was 12 months.
Intraoperative findings demonstrated disruption of normal architecture and
areolar tissue, with extensive scar in the dissection planes after previous
injection. Mean preoperative/postinjection joint contracture for
metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints was 42 and 60 degrees,
respectively; after surgery, joint contractures were 0 and 21 degrees,
respectively. Significant improvement in postoperative range of motion was seen
for both metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints after palmar
fasciectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum injections may produce a deeply
scarred bed and increase the technical difficulty of salvage fasciectomy.
However, results of palmar fasciectomy are comparable to those of primary
fasciectomy even in the setting of recurrent or progressive disease.
CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV.
