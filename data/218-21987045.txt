BACKGROUND: The increasing number of methods for treating Dupuytren's disease
indicates a need for comparative studies. In this article, the 5-year follow-up
results of a randomized controlled study that compared percutaneous needle
fasciotomy and limited fasciectomy are presented.
METHODS: One hundred eleven patients with 115 affected hands with a minimal
passive extension deficit of 30 degrees were assigned randomly to the two groups.
Follow-up examinations were performed at 1 and 6 weeks; 6 months; and 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 years. Outcome parameters were total passive extension deficit, patient
satisfaction, flexion, and sensibility. Furthermore, disease extension was
recorded. The primary endpoint was recurrence, defined as an increase of total
passive extension deficit of greater than 30 degrees. Ninety-three patients
reached this endpoint.
RESULTS: The recurrence rate after 5 years in the needle fasciotomy group (84.9
percent) was significantly higher than in the limited fasciectomy group (20.9
percent) (p < 0.001), and occurred significantly sooner in the needle fasciotomy 
group (p = 0.001). Older age at the time of treatment decreased the recurrence
rate (p = 0.005). No other diathesis characteristics influenced recurrence.
Patient satisfaction was high in both groups but was significantly higher in the 
limited fasciectomy group. Nevertheless, many patients (53 percent) preferred
percutaneous needle fasciotomy in case of recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy is the preferred treatment for
elderly patients with Dupuytren's disease and for those willing to accept a
possible early recurrence in the context of the advantages, such as fast
recovery, a low complication rate, and minimal invasiveness.
