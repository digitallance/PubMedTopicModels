Dynamism of Dupuytren's contractures may occur if a contracture crosses over both
the metacarpophalangeal (MCPJ) and proximal interphalangeal (PIPJ) joints of one 
finger. In this situation the extension deficit at one joint can be influenced by
the position of the other. This may affect clinical measurements and introduce
errors and bias into research using angular deformity as an endpoint. This study 
reports the dynamism encountered when measuring passive joint extension deficits 
in pre-operative contractures. Eighty-five digits with a contracture affecting
the PIPJ or MCPJ and PIPJ on 72 hands from 70 patients were studied. Seventy-six 
digits showed dynamism at either the MCPJ or PIPJ (89%). Seventy-four showed
dynamism at the PIPJ (87%). The mean dynamism observed was 6° at the MCPJ and 14°
at the PIPJ. Previous Dupuytren's surgery to the finger did not influence the
amount of dynamism seen. Dynamism is common and may be a source of error or bias 
in trials of Dupuytren's disease treatment.
