PURPOSE: To determine the effect of a specific orthotic intervention and therapy 
protocol on proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures of greater than 40°
caused by Dupuytren disease and treated with collagenase injections.
METHODS: All patients with PIP joints contracted at least 40° by Dupuytren
disease were prospectively invited to participate in the study. Following
standard collagenase injection and cord rupture by a hand surgeon, a certified
hand therapist evaluated and treated each patient based on a defined treatment
protocol that consisted of orthotic intervention to address residual PIP joint
contracture. In addition, exercises were initiated emphasizing reverse blocking
for PIP joint extension and distal interphalangeal joint flexion exercises with
the PIP joint held in extension to lengthen a frequently shortened oblique
retinacular ligament. Patients were assessed before injection, immediately after 
injection, and 1 and 4 weeks later. There were 22 fingers in 21 patients. The
mean age at treatment was 63 years (range, 37-80 y).
RESULTS: The mean baseline passive PIP joint contracture was 56° (range, 40° to
80°). At cord rupture, the mean PIP joint contracture became 22° (range, 0° to
55°). One week after cord rupture and therapy, the contracture decreased further 
to a mean of 12° (range, 0° to 36°). By 4 weeks, the mean contracture was 7°
(range, 0° to 35°). The differences in PIP joint contracture were statistically
significant at all time points except when comparing the means at 1 week and 4
weeks. The results represent an 88% improvement of the PIP joint contracture.
CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, it appears that severe PIP joint contractures
benefit from specific, postinjection orthotic intervention and targeted
exercises.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
