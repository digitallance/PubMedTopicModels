BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal manifestations of diabetes in the upper limb are well
recognized. No data has been available in this regard from Pakistan. Our aim was 
to find out the frequency of upper limb musculoskeletal abnormalities in diabetic
patients.
METHODS: This was an observational study in which type 2 diabetes patients
attending our diabetic clinic were enrolled along with age and gender matched
controls. Data was analyzed on SPSS 16.
RESULTS: In total, 210 Type 2 diabetics (male 34.3%, female 65.7%) and 203
controls (male 35%, female 65%) were recruited. The mean age was 50.7± 10.2 years
in diabetic group as compared to 49.5±10.6 years in the control group. The
frequencies of hand region abnormalities were significantly higher in the
diabetic subjects as compared to the controls (20.4%, p-value <0.001). Limited
joint mobility (9.5% vs 2.5%), carpal tunnel syndrome (9% vs 2%), trigger finger 
(3.8% vs 0.5%), and dupuytren's contracture (1% vs 0%) were found more frequent
as compared to controls (all p-values <0.05). In the shoulder region of diabetic 
subjects, adhesive capsulitis and tendonitis was found in 10.9% and 9.5%
respectively as compared to 2.5% and 2% in control group [p- value <0.001]. A
weak but positive relationship was observed between age and duration of diabetes 
with these upper limb abnormalities. However, no correlation was found between
the frequencies of these abnormalities with control of diabetes.
CONCLUSION: A higher frequency of upper limb musculoskeletal abnormalities was
observed in Type 2 diabetic patients as compared to control group.
