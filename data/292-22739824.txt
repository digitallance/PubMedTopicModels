Specific musical instruments can be a source of physical problems to their
players. Based on reviews of the literature and personal experience, this paper
summarizes current knowledge of problems affecting musicians who play instruments
in the bassoon family (including the bassoon, contrabassoon, and several other
instruments). Prevalence rates are higher in reports of surveys (ranging up to
86%), compared to clinical reports of patients seen and treated. Significant risk
factors include young age, small body size, female gender, and use of large
instruments. Problems unique to bassoonists are rare; most physical difficulties 
also are seen in general musculoskeletal clinical practices and in musicians
playing all types of instruments. The left upper extremity is more commonly
affected by overuse-related conditions in bassoonists. Non-playing-related
problems are equally important for consideration (such as degenerative disorders 
and acute trauma), since they also affect practice and performance. Little
experimental data exist to validate current and widely-held principles of
treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention.
