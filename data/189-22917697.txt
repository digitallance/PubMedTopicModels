Dupuytren's and Ledderhose disease can be a cumbersome condition in patients with
a severe diathesis with a very early onset. Two brothers are described with a
reversed radial forearm flap on both hands and two upper lateral arm flaps on
both feet with a long-term follow-up ranging from 14 to 25 years. They had
multiple procedures of both hands before the flaps were considered. No recurrence
occurred under the flap. In very severe diathesis flaps should be considered in
an earlier phase to prevent multiple procedures and early recurrence.
