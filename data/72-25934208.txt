This evidence-based article discusses the current management options of Dupuytren
disease and strategies to avoid and manage any potential complications. Treatment
options include fasciectomy, needle fasciotomy/aponeurotomy, and collagenase
injection. Complications include digital nerve and artery injury, flexor tendon
injury, skin fissures and wound healing complications, hematoma, infection, flare
reaction/complex regional pain syndrome, and recurrence. Complication rates,
prevention, and management differ with each treatment modality. A detailed
understanding of each of these options allows hand surgeons to select the most
appropriate treatment for each patient.
