BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An internet-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was
conducted to elicit preferences for a wide range of Dupuytren's contracture
(DC)-related health states. An algorithm was subsequently developed to convert
these preferences into health state utilities that can be used to assess DC's
impact on quality of life and the value of its treatments.
METHODS: Health state preferences for varying levels of DC hand severity were
elicited via an internet survey from a sample of the UK adult population.
Severity levels were defined using a combination of contractures (0, 45, or 90
degrees) in 8 proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the
index, middle, ring, and little fingers. Right-handed, left-handed, and
ambidextrous respondents indicated which hand was preferable in each of the 10
randomly-selected hand-pairings comparing different DC severity levels. For
consistency across comparisons, anatomically precise digital hand drawings were
used. To anchor preferences onto the traditional 0-1 utility scale used in health
economic evaluations, unaffected hands were assigned a utility of 1.0 whereas the
utility for a maximally affected hand (i.e., all 8 joints set at 90 degrees of
contracture) was derived by asking respondents to indicate what combination of
attributes and levels of the EQ-5D-5L profile most accurately reflects the impact
of living with such hand. Conditional logistic models were used to estimate
indirect utilities, then rescaled to the anchor points on the EQ-5D-5L.
RESULTS: Estimated utilities based on the responses of 1,745 qualified
respondents were 0.49, 0.57, and 0.63 for completely affected dominant hands,
non-dominant hands, or ambidextrous hands, respectively. Utility for a dominant
hand with 90-degree contracture in t h e metacarpophalangeal joints of the ring
and little fingers was estimated to be 0.89. Separately, reducing the contracture
of metacarpophalangeal joint for a little finger from 50 to 12 degrees would
improve utility by 0.02.
INTERPRETATION: DC is associated with substantial utility decrements. The
algorithms presented herein provide a robust and flexible framework to assess
utility for varying degrees of DC severity.
