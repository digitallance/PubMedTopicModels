BACKGROUND: Numerous options exist for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. 
This study describes the technique and early results of partial fasciectomy
through a mini-incision approach as an additional treatment option for
Dupuytren's disease.
METHODS: This procedure involves the excision of diseased Dupuytren's tissue with
the use of multiple 1 cm transverse incisions. Patient demographics, digit
involvement, the number of incisions required to release each digit, and
complications were recorded for all patients. Range of motion data was obtained
from a subgroup of patients that had at least 6 months of follow-up. A paired t
test was used to compare preoperative and postoperative contracture.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients underwent 75 procedures that involved 119 digits.
The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 63 years (range, 33-95 years). A 
total of 32 digits (47 joints) were available for range of motion analysis. After
a mean of 2.2 years following surgery, metacarpophalangeal joint contractures
maintained correction (34° preoperatively, 19° postoperatively, p = 0.008). After
a mean postoperative duration of 2.0 years, proximal interphalangeal joint
contractures trended worse than preoperative levels (39° preoperatively, 45°
postoperatively, p = 0.319). There was one major complication, which consisted of
a nerve laceration that was identified and repaired intraoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Partial fasciectomy through the described mini-incision approach
provides an additional surgical option for patients who desire a less invasive
surgical procedure than traditional fascietomy. Although this procedure is safe
and effective at achieving immediate cord release, maintenance of correction for 
proximal interphalangeal joint contractures remains problematic.
