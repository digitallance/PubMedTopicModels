OBJECTIVES: In recent studies, collagen organization was blamed for the formation
of capsular contracture which is still a challenging problem after silicone
implant-based breast operations. In this study, effects of different
concentrations of collagenase enzyme derived from Clostridium histolyticum on the
capsular tissue formation around the silicone implants were investigated. The
injectable form of collagenase has a routine clinical use in the treatment of
both Dupuytren's and Peyronie's diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two Wistar albino rats were randomized into four
groups. A 2 × 1 × 0.3-cm-sized silicone block was inserted inside a dorsal
subcutaneous pocket in all groups. After 2 months of insertion, capsule
thicknesses around the implants were detected under ultrasonography. This was
followed by injection of isotonic saline, 150, 300, and 600 IU in Gr-1, 2, 3, and
4, respectively. All the animals were sacrificed at the end of the first week for
histologic sampling to determine fibroblast proliferation, vessel density of the 
tissue, necrosis, edema, inflammation, and capsule thickness. All the data were
statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests and compared
for significance of the results.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in terms of capsule thinning between
the 300 and 600 IU groups but in both groups thinning was significantly higher
than the sham group. In the 150 IU group there was no significant thinning as
compared to the sham group (p > 0.05). However, complications such as skin
necrosis, infection, and seroma formation were seen only in the 600 IU injection 
group. The optimal safe and effective dose of the enzyme was accepted as 300 IU. 
The 300 IU injection provided up to 89 % thinning in the capsule tissue. There
was thinning of the collagen bundles parallel to capsule thickness. In the 600 IU
group, micro-pores were encountered at the thinnest points.
CONCLUSION: However, the late results and recurrence rates of capsular
contracture were not included in this study; collagenase seemed effective for the
reduction of capsular tissue around the implants.
