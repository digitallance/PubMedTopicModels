LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able 
to: (1) Perform needle aponeurotomy, fat grafting, Digit Widget insertion, and
collagenase injection for Dupuytren's cords. (2) Describe how cords can be
stretched without surgery. (3) Explain to patients the risks and benefits of
these new alternatives of treatments.
SUMMARY: Surgery for Dupuytren's contracture used to be the only alternative of
treatment. The past 5 years have seen the widespread adoption of minimally
invasive treatments in the form of needle aponeurotomy and collagenase injection 
to disrupt the cords and restore range of motion. Even newer and perhaps as
effective treatments such as fat grafting and mechanical stretching with the
Digit Widget may also end up being important tools of treatment. The reader will 
be introduced to all of these modalities with text, illustration, and videos.
