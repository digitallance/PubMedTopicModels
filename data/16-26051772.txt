We present a 58-year-old right-handed man, who consulted us with an 11-year
history of Dupuytren's disease. To correct contracture of the little finger, we
performed regional fasciectomy, skin grafting, and distraction arthrolysis of the
proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint using an external fixator. Preoperative or
postoperative skeletal traction has been advocated to treat potential or residual
stiffness of the PIP joint in Dupuytren's contracture, but its intraoperative use
has not been reported before. Our method has the advantage of treating each
problem caused by Dupuytren's disease. A good range of painless PIP joint motion 
is achieved by our intraoperative distraction technique without interfering with 
the skin graft and without reducing extensor tone, while the healing period is
shortened by performing all procedures simultaneously.
