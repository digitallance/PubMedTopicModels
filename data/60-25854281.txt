BACKGROUND: This retrospective study documents the proportion of hand clinic
patients presenting with palmar fibromatosis with and without contracture.
METHODS: All "new" patients >18 years presenting to a single surgeon's hand
clinic over a 16-month period were included, and information was abstracted from 
chart review regarding patient demographics, reason for presentation, presence or
absence of palmar fibromatosis, contracture, and prior known diagnosis of
Dupuytren's disease. The percentage of asymptomatic patients with palmar
fibromatosis was calculated.
RESULTS: Of 827 patients, 306 had palmar fibromatosis. Among all patients, 33% of
male and 40% of female patients had palmar fibromatosis. Only 8% had
contractures, while 92% had palmar fibromatosis without contracture. Among those 
who had contractures, 81% presented with a primary complaint of Dupuytren's
disease (symptomatic contracture). Prevalence of palmar fibromatosis increased
with increasing age.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate that Dupuytren's palmar fibromatosis is
common and often present without overt contractures.
