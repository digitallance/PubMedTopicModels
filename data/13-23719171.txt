In clinical trials, treating Dupuytren's contracture with collagenase injection
involves manipulation the day after injection, without local anaesthesia. We
evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of manipulation 2 days after injection
with local anaesthesia. Forty-five patients received 50 injections into cords
contracting metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints; follow-up
visits were at 3 and 14 weeks. For the metacarpophalangeal joints there were >90%
reduction in contracture at both visits. The proximal interphalangeal joints that
improved spontaneously after metacarpophalangeal injection or received direct
injections showed 51-55% reduction in contracture. Changes in scores on the
Patient Evaluation Measure suggest that patients perceived improvements in their 
hand function was good and they were satisfied with the procedure. Collagenase
and local anaesthesia injections were well tolerated; adverse events were
localized to the injection site and were mild and transient in nature. These
findings provide another viable option for practising surgeons and may help with 
the logistics of patient care.
