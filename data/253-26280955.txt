Hand disorders associated with diabetes: a review.

Zyluk A, Puchalski P.

The diabetes may cause damage many structures and organs of a human body and
predispose to secondary disorders, including involvement of the hand. Carpal
tunnel syndrome, trigger finger or Dupuytren's disease occur more frequently in
diabetic patients as well as other, poorer recognized conditions such as limited 
joint mobility, or hand weakness. The paper presents these disorders, emphasizes 
differences in clinical presentation, methods and outcomes of treatment,
comparing to the non-diabetic patients. Although there are not call
complications, some evidence suggests that they may be, as their prevalence is
related to the duration of the diabetes, poor metabolic control and occurrence of
other disorders such as retino- and nephropathy.
