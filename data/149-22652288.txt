Dupuytren's disease was first described by Baron Guillaume Dupuytren in 1831. He 
outlined the pathology of palmar fascia thickening and contracture resulting in
flexion of one or more digits. Dupuytren's disease usually affects the little or 
ring fingers, with the thumb rarely affected. Furthermore, the thumb in isolation
is only affected in 0.5% of cases, with contracture at the metacarpophalangeal
joint. We present a unique and interesting case of Dupuytren's disease
predominantly of the thumbs, with isolated contractures bilaterally at the
interphalangeal joints, in a 59 year old lady with epilepsy who was otherwise fit
and well. To our knowledge this disease pattern has never been reported in the
literature. Furthermore a relevant literature review of Dupuytren's disease
affecting the thumb, in particular the interphalangeal joint, is presented. Our
interesting and unique case reinforces the notion that the disease pathogenesis
is diverse and multifactorial, and provides a further interesting example for the
literature.
