BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fairly prevalent yet under-recognised
disorder of the palmar fascia, resulting in fixed-flexion contractures of joints 
in the hand. Numerous population-based studies have been conducted in countries
around the world, and published prevalence estimates vary widely. Nevertheless,
most studies have shown that the prevalence of DD increases with age. Because the
global population is aging, the prevalence of DD will also continue to increase.
SCOPE: Patients with DD typically present to a variety of physicians, generalists
and specialists alike. Thus, it is critical that providers have clear guidance on
the early recognition of signs and symptoms, comprehensive evaluation of
potential risk factors, differential diagnosis and when to refer a patient for
treatment. Treatment options range from minimally invasive injections with
collagenase to surgery.
FINDINGS: Results from a large-scale study of the surgical management of DD in
Europe indicate that most DD diagnoses and referrals are made by general
practitioners, but there is much inter-country variation. Different patient- and 
physician-based factors affect diagnosis rates and referral pathways. Different
healthcare systems and regulations are also influential. A simple management
algorithm is provided herein and explained.
CONCLUSION: It is important for generalists to understand the natural history of 
DD and the potential benefits of early referral and treatment. General
practitioners should diagnose and/or refer patients with DD to a specialist as
early as possible to optimise disease management and treatment outcomes.
