Although much has been published about the treatment of Dupuytren's disease,
there is no clear consensus regarding the most effective form of treatment. Part 
of this uncertainty may result from the absence of a universal method of
assessing this condition. We undertook a review of the literature in order to
summarize the various methods by which Dupuytren's disease has been measured and 
quantified. We included all articles that offered a classification or assessment 
system for the disease. We excluded articles that dealt solely with surgical
technique (although inevitably there was some overlap). We conclude that there
are many methods of assessment, but that none of them is perfect and that further
work is needed in the field.
