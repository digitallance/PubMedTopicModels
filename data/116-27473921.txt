PURPOSE: This study compared the efficacy of collagenase treatment and needle
fasciotomy for contracture of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint in Dupuytren
disease.
METHODS: This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized study with follow-up 1
week and 1 year after treatment. One hundred and forty patients with an MCP
contracture of 20° or more in a single finger were enrolled, of whom 69 patients 
were randomized to collagenase treatment and 71 patients to needle fasciotomy.
The patients were followed at 1 week and were examined by a physiotherapist after
1 year. Measurements of joint movement and grip strength were recorded as well as
patient-perceived outcomes measured by the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de
la Main (URAM) questionnaire and a visual analog scale (VAS) for the estimation
of procedural pain and subjective treatment efficacy.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent of the patients in the collagenase group and 90% of
the patients in the needle fasciotomy group had a reduction in their MCP
contracture to less than 5° 1 week after treatment, and the median gains in
passive MCP movement were 48° and 46°, respectively. The median VAS score for
procedural pain was 4.9 of 10 in the collagenase group and 2.7 of 10 in the
needle fasciotomy group. After 1 year, 90% of the patients in both groups had
full extension of the treated MCP joint. One patient in each group had a
recurrence of the contracture. The median improvement in URAM score was 8 units
in both groups and the VAS estimation of treatment efficacy by the patients was
8.7 of 10 in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference between the treatment outcomes
after collagenase and needle fasciotomy treatment after 1 year.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.
