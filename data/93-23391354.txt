Treatment of Dupuytren disease with collagenase clostridium histolyticum is
increasingly used among hand surgeons. Although it is generally safe and
efficacious, complications related to enzymatic fasciotomy occur. Postapproval
surveillance and communication among hand surgeons continues to refine the
indications, contraindications, and complications recognized in the treatment of 
Dupuytren disease with enzymatic therapy. Major treatment-related adverse events 
previously reported include flexor tendon rupture and complex regional pain
syndrome. We report a patient who experienced total loss of a well-established
volar ring finger skin graft following collagenase injection and propose a
potential mechanism of vulnerability. This case may illustrate the susceptibility
of type I collagen, which is uniformly present in a healed skin graft bed, to
degradation with collagenase. We propose a cautious approach when considering
treatment of a Dupuytren cord with collagenase in the presence of an overlying
skin graft, regardless of the age of the graft.
