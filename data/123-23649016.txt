We investigated the difficulty of surgical fasciectomy after previous treatment
with clostridial collagenase injection. The 35 clinicians who had participated in
the initial trials of this injection were contacted via email. Twenty-eight
responded, nine of whom reported on 15 patients. Most (seven of nine) felt there 
was no significant distortion of anatomy and rated the level of technical
difficulty as equivalent to a primary Dupuytren's fasciectomy at the observed
degree of contracture (nine of 15 cases). One respondent (four of 15 cases)
reported significantly more difficulty and grossly distorted anatomy. One
surgical complication, a wound dehiscence, was reported.
