BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to analyze and compare the use of direct health
resources and costs generated in the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture using
two different techniques: subtotal fasciectomy and infiltration with Collagenase 
Clostridium Histolyticum (CCH) in regular clinical practice at the Orthopedic and
Traumatology Surgery (OTS) Department at the Hospital de Denia (Spain).
METHODS: Observational, retrospective study based on data from the computerized
clinical histories of two groups of patients- those treated surgically using a
one or two digit subtotal fasciectomy technique (FSC) and those treated with CCH 
infiltration, monitored in regular clinical practice from February, 2009 to May, 
2012. Demographic (age, sex), clinical (number of digits affected and which ones)
and use of resources (hospitalizations, medical visits, tests and drugs) data
were collected. Resource use and associated costs, according to the hospital's
accounting department, were compared based on the type of treatment from Spain's 
National Health Service.
RESULTS: 91 patients (48 (52.8%) in the FSC group) were identified. The average
age and number of digits affected was 65.9 (9.2) years and 1.33 (0.48) digits
affected in the FSC group, and 65.1 (9.7) years and 1.16 (0.4) digits in the CCH 
group.Overall, the costs of treating Dupuytren's disease with subtotal FSC amount
to €1,814 for major ambulatory surgery and €1,961 with hospital stay including
admission, surgical intervention (€904), examinations, dressings and
physiotherapy. As to collagenase infiltration, costs amount to €952 (including
minor surgery admission, vial with product, office examination and dressings).
Finally, comparing total costs for treatments, a savings of €388 is estimated in 
favor of CCH treatment in the best-case scenario (patient under MAS system with
no need for physiotherapy) and €1,008 in the worst-case scenario (patient
admitted to hospital needing subsequent physiotherapy), implying a savings of 29%
and 51%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that treating patients with DC by injection 
with CCH at the OTS department of the Hospital de Denia generates a total savings
of 29% and 51% (€388 and €1008) compared with fasciectomy at the time of
treatment. Long term evolution of CCH treatment is uncertain and the recurrence
rate unknown.
