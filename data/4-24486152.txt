BACKGROUND AND AIM: The options for treating patients with Dupuytren's
contracture have broadened with the introduction of collagenase. Although the
literature would suggest that collagenase treatment is effective, has few
complications and is popular with patients, it has not been widely commissioned
by the National Health Services of the United Kingdom and other European
countries due to concerns about cost. The aim of this study was to compare the
cost of surgical fasciectomy to collagenase injections for the treatment of
Dupuytren's contracture in a single centre.
METHOD: Prospective data on 40 patients undergoing fasciectomy or collagenase
injection (20 patients in each group) were collected between January and March
2013. Financial data on the costs of the procedures, equipment, theatre time and 
follow-up appointments were calculated.
RESULTS: The average cost of an open partial fasciectomy pathway was £ 7115.34
and that of a collagenase pathway was £ 2110.62. Eight collagenase patients had
physician-led follow-up appointments and only three had hand physiotherapy
appointments. By contrast, every fasciectomy patient had at least one physician
and one physiotherapist follow-up appointment routinely.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that collagenase treatment for 
Dupuytren's contracture of a single digit in selected patients is just over £
5000 less than treatment for the same condition using surgical fasciectomy.
Collagenase-treated patients require much less physician- and physiotherapist-led
postoperative follow-up.
