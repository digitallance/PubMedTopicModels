We present a patient with keloid scars and Dupuytren's contracture comprising the
polyfibromatosis syndrome; four members over three generations of his family are 
also affected. To our knowledge this is the first familial case reported of
polyfibromatosis with this specific phenotypic presentation and probable X-linked
recessive inheritance.
