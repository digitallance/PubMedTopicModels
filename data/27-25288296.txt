Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative condition of the palm, with a
predilection for men, which has affected Northern Europeans since the Viking
conquests. Although strongly heritable, clear evidence exists for environmental
factors that modify the underlying genetic risk, such as diabetes, heavy
drinking, and smoking. Evidence also exists for epilepsy (probably due to
treatment with certain anti-epileptic drugs), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus
infection. Recent large studies have shown no relationship with manual labour or 
vibrating tools. Two theories have emerged regarding the pathogenic mechanism:
the first attributes the aberrant healing process that characterises Dupuytren's 
to free radicals, generated as a result of microangiopathy, whereas the second
cites a genetic tendency toward apoptosis-resistant myofibroblasts. Despite only 
one study demonstrating linkage, emerging data from genome-wide association
studies highlight a series of single nucleotide polymorphisms near members of the
Wnt signalling pathway, and transcriptional profiling studies have consistently
identified certain components of the extracellular matrix.
