PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the HLA phenotype in
Dupuytren's contracture (DC) patients in order to verify the correlation of these
alleles with risk factors for development of DC in the Brazilian population.
METHODS: This was a case-controlled study of 25 DC patients and 443 healthy
individuals with no history of HLA-associated diseases. HLA class I and class II 
typing was performed using the polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer
method.
RESULTS: The HLAB*18 phenotype was observed in 32% of the patients and 10.5% of
controls. However, P values did not remain significant after correction.
DISCUSSION: Although we observed an increased tendency of DC patients to possess 
the HLA-B*18 allele, the results were not statistically significant after
correction. This allele was higher in patients of Italian and/or Spanish
ethnicity, localities with frequencies higher than 18.0% and 14.0% respectively. 
Further investigation with a larger cohort of DC patients is required to confirm 
the potential role of HLA in this disease.
