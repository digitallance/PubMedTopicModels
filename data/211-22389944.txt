We investigated interrater reliability of motion (ROM) measurement in the finger 
joints of people with Dupuytren's disease. Eight raters measured flexion and
extension of the three finger joints in one affected finger of each of 13 people 
with different levels of severity of Dupuytren's disease, giving 104 measures of 
joints and motions. Reliability measures, represented by intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC), standard error of the mean (SEM), and differences between
raters with the highest and lowest mean scores, were calculated. ICCs ranged from
.832 to .973 depending on joint and motion. The SEM was ≤3° for all joints and
motions. Differences in mean between highest and lowest raters were larger for
flexion than for extension; the largest difference was in the distal
interphalangeal joint. The results indicate that following these standardized
guidelines, the interrater reliability of goniometer measurements is high for
digital ROM in people with Dupuytren's disease.
