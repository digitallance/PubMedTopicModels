BACKGROUND: Most managed care plans use a physician "gatekeeper" to control
referrals to hand surgeons. The appropriateness of this model for upper extremity
complaints has never been challenged. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
the prior management of patients with elective hand disorders who present to a
hand surgery clinic.
METHODS: All patients presenting to a tertiary, academic medical center for a
new-patient hand surgery evaluation from February 3, 2011, to June 15, 2011, were
prospectively enrolled. Patients were evaluated for prior provider, diagnosis,
treatment, and complications. Actual diagnosis, recommended workup, and
appropriate treatment were determined independently by two experienced hand
examiners. Traumatic injuries and surgeon disagreements in diagnosis and
treatment were excluded, leaving 125 patients.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of patients had been evaluated by a primary care
provider. Overall, the correct diagnosis was established 34 percent of the time. 
Nerve compression syndromes were diagnosed with the greatest accuracy (64
percent), whereas stenosing tenosynovitis was diagnosed correctly only 15 percent
of the time. Before presentation, 74 percent of patients had undergone a study or
intervention. On review, 70 percent of studies/interventions were deemed
unnecessary. Advanced imaging was unwarranted in 90 percent of patients who
received it. Seventeen percent of patients experienced a complication. Most (67
percent) were caused by a delay in diagnosis, whereas 33 percent resulted from an
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Health care providers less familiar with an examination of the hand 
often misdiagnose and mistreat common problems. A referral system may not be the 
most efficient means of delivering care to patients with elective hand maladies.
