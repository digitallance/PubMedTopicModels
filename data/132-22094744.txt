BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a common benign fibroproliferative disorder of
the hand. Epidemiologic studies have reported significant variation in disease
prevalence among races, focusing primarily on those of northern European descent.
In contrast, Dupuytren's disease in the Hispanic population has received little
attention. Thus, in this study, the authors aimed to determine the prevalence and
operative rate of Dupuytren's disease in the Hispanic, black, white, Asian,
Native American, and other races and to characterize the disease presentation in 
Hispanics who required surgical treatment.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted to identify the racial distribution
of Dupuytren's disease patients seen at Bellevue Hospital between July of 2000
and August of 2010. In Hispanic patients requiring surgical treatment for their
disease, data were collected on the following parameters: age, sex, ethnicity,
hand dominance, hand affected, and digits operated on. Epidemiologic factors
including smoking, alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, epilepsy,
and hypertension were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Dupuytren's disease prevalence was found to be 533 per 100,000 in
Hispanics. Of these patients, 1.8 percent required surgical treatment, and this
group was characterized by the following comorbidities: smoking (57.1 percent),
hypertension (57.1 percent), alcoholism (52.4 percent), diabetes mellitus (47.6
percent), and hypercholesterolemia (19.0 percent).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results indicate that Dupuytren's disease is more
prevalent in the Hispanic population than previously reported. Although the
epidemiologic factors identified in Hispanics with Dupuytren's disease are
similar to those in other races investigated, there are important differences
with respect to clinical presentation and surgical treatment.
