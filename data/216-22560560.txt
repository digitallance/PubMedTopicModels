PURPOSE: The etiology of Dupuytren disease is unclear. Pain is seldom described
in the literature. Patients are more often disturbed by impaired extension of the
fingers. We recently treated a series of patients who had had painful nodules for
more than 1 year, and we therefore decided to investigate them for a possible
anatomical correlate.
METHODS: Biopsies were taken during surgery from patients with Dupuytren disease 
and stained to enable detection of neuronal tissue.
RESULTS: We treated 17 fingers in 10 patients. Intraoperatively, 10 showed tiny
nerve branches passing into or crossing the fibrous bands or nodules. Of 13
biopsies, 6 showed nerve fibers embedded in fibrous tissue, 3 showed perineural
or intraneural fibrosis or both, and 3 showed true neuromas. Enlarged Pacinian
corpuscles were isolated from 1 sample. All patients were pain free after
surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Although Dupuytren disease is generally considered painless, we
treated a series of early stage patients with painful disease. Intraoperative
inspection and histological examination of tissue samples showed that nerve
tissue was involved in all cases. The pain might have been due to local nerve
compression by the fibromatosis or the Dupuytren disease itself. We, therefore,
suggest that the indication for surgery in Dupuytren disease be extended to
painful nodules for more than 1 year, even in the early stages of the disease in 
the absence of functional deficits, with assessment of tissue samples for
histological changes in nerves.
