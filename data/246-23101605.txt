Dupuytren disease (DD) is a benign, generally painless connective tissue disorder
affecting the palmar fascia that leads to progressive hand contractures. Mediated
by myofibroblasts, the disease most commonly begins as a nodule in the palm or
finger, and can progress where pathologic cords form leading to progressive
flexion deformity of the involved fingers. The palmar skin overlying the cords
may become excessively calloused and contracted and involved joints may develop
periarticular fibrosis. Although there is no cure, the sequellae of this
affliction can be corrected. This article focuses on the role of collagen in DD
and the development of a collagen-specific enzymatic treatment for DD
contractures.
