BACKGROUND: Controversy exists about the relative effectiveness of injectable
collagenase (collagenase clostridium histolyticum) and limited fasciectomy in the
treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. The authors compared the effectiveness of
both techniques in actual clinical practice.
METHODS: This study evaluated all subjects treated with collagenase clostridium
histolyticum or limited fasciectomy for metacarpophalangeal and/or proximal
interphalangeal joint contractures between 2011 and 2014 at seven practice sites.
The authors compared the degree of residual contracture (active extension
deficit), Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire scores, and adverse events at
follow-up visits occurring between 6 and 12 weeks after surgery or the last
injection with the use of propensity score matching.
RESULTS: In 132 matched subjects who were treated with collagenase (n = 66) or
fasciectomy (n = 66), the degree of residual contracture at follow-up for
affected metacarpophalangeal joints was not significantly different (13 degrees
versus 6 degrees; p = 0.095) and affected proximal interphalangeal joints had
significantly worse residual contracture in the collagenase group compared with
those in the fasciectomy group (25 degrees versus 15 degrees; p = 0.010).
Collagenase subjects experienced fewer serious adverse events than did
fasciectomy subjects and reported larger improvements in the Michigan Hand
Outcomes Questionnaire subscores evaluating satisfaction with hand function,
activities of daily living, and work performance.
CONCLUSIONS: This propensity score-matched study showed that collagenase
clostridium histolyticum was not significantly different from limited fasciectomy
in reducing metacarpophalangeal joint contractures, whereas proximal
interphalangeal joint contractures showed slightly better reduction following
limited fasciectomy. Collagenase provided a more rapid recovery of hand function 
than did fasciectomy and was associated with fewer serious adverse events.
