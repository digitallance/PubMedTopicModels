INTRODUCTION: In a patient with recurrent Dupuytren's disease, we performed
dermofasciectomy including the diseased skin and soft tissue, and covered the
soft tissue defect using an ulnar parametacarpal flap.
CASE REPORT: A 65-year-old man had undergone invasive aponeurectomy for
Dupuytren's contracture of the right 5th finger 3 years before, but showed
recurrence about 1 year after surgery. Since a skin ulcer was noted at the site
of recurrence, dermofasciectomy including the scarred skin was performed on the
palmar side of the 5th finger, and the skin defect was covered with an ulnar
parametacarpal flap. No recurrence has been noted for the 6 months since the
surgery.
CONCLUSION: The ulnar parametacarpal flap, in which the vascular pedicle is easy 
to identify, is useful for covering a skin defect on the palmar side of the 5th
finger if used as an island flap. However, a disadvantage of this flap is that it
is likely to develop congestion due to poor venous return.
