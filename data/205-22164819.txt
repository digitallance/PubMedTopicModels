Since the publication of Baron Dupuytren's first paper 180 years ago, the
treatment of Dupuytren's disease continues to be problematic. Because of the high
recurrence rate following surgery, there has been a shift to more radical
surgical options. Unfortunately, this has led to more frequent and sometimes
serious postoperative complications. Recently, there has been renewed interest in
the original treatment for Dupuytren's disease: simple fasciotomy of the diseased
cord. One method of fasciotomy is needle aponeurotomy, which can be done in the
office as an outpatient with local anesthesia. The indications for the surgical
treatment of Dupuytren's disease and the technique for needle aponeurotomy are
discussed in this paper.
