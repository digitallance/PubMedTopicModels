INTRODUCTION: Peyronie's disease (PD) is commonly seen in middle-aged men, and
little is known about this condition in teenagers.
AIM: To investigate the characteristics of PD in teenagers.
METHODS: The findings were compared between patients with the disease who were
teenagers with those over 40 years of age. Statistical analyses were conducted to
define differentiating features between these two groups.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The demographics, clinical features, and associated
comorbidities of patients with PD were reviewed.
RESULTS: Thirty-two teenaged males were evaluated for PD in a single institution 
over a 10-year period. The median age for our cohort was 18 (15-19) years.
Forty-five percent of patients had already been seen by another urologist, and
28% had been told they did not have PD. The mean duration of PD before seeking
medical care in our cohort was 3 ± 1 months. Sixteen percent of patients reported
antecedent penile trauma, half of which happened during coitus or masturbation,
and 18% of patients had hemoglobin (Hb) A1c levels > 5%. Dupuytren's contracture 
was not seen in this population. Twenty-two percent of patients presented with
penile pain. Subsequent ED was seen in 37% of patients. Multiple noncontiguous
plaques were seen in 37% of patients. Twelve percent were previously treated with
vitamin E, while another 12% had previous intralesional verapamil. High distress 
was reported by 94% of patients. Thirty-four percent sought medical attention for
anxiety/mood disorder, and 28% had a negative encounter with a sexual partner
related to PD. All of the 32 patients had penile curvature with a mean of 32 ± 12
degrees. Seventy-two percent of the patients had dorsal curvature while 22% had
an associated deformity. Using duplex Doppler ultrasound, 12% had a calcified
plaque, while none of the patients had abnormal hemodynamics. When compared with 
PD in adults, teenagers had greater than seven times the prevalence of multiple
noncontiguous plaques (37% vs. 5%). Also, the prevalence of HbA1c level > 5% was 
higher in the teenagers as well (18% vs. 5%).
CONCLUSIONS: PD does occur in teenagers often causing high distress levels.
Compared to older adults, teenagers often present earlier, and more commonly have
elevated HbA1c level and increased number of plaques at presentation.
