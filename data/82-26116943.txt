Dupuytren disease is a progressive fibroproliferative disorder, which leads to
flexion contractures of the digits. A minimally invasive technique consisting of 
an extensive percutaneous aponeurotomy of the cord with a needle combined with
lipofilling is presented. The selective cutting of the cords under continuous
tension disintegrates the cords while sparing the looser neurovascular bundles.
Subsequently, lipoaspirate is injected subcutaneously. The authors' prospective
results show a significantly shorter recovery time and less overall complications
in this technique when compared with open surgery, while no significant
difference was observed in the extent of immediate contracture correction and in 
the recurrence rate at 1 year follow-up.
