Skoog and others have concluded that the Skoog fibres, or transverse ligament of 
the palmar aponeurosis (TLPA), are never involved in the Dupuytren's disease
process. Here we present a case in which this clearly occurs. Whilst for the vast
majority of Dupuytren's cases the Skoog's fibres delineate the required deep
extent of dissection for pretendinous cords, this case proves an exception,
highlighting an occasional need to beware of accepting the conventional wisdom.
