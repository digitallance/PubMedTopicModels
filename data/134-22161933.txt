We report the case of an 82-year-old man who underwent fasciectomy for a severe
Dupuytren's contracture, during which an ossified lesion was encountered within
the contracture and surrounding the neurovascular bundle. The abnormal tissue was
removed with difficulty and heterotopic ossification was confirmed
histologically. We believe this is the first report of heterotopic ossification
in Dupuytren's disease.
