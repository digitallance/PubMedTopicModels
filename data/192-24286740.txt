PNA is one of many treatments available for the treatment of hand contractures
resulting from Dupuytren’s disease. It is generally recommended for elderly
patients with less severe contractures who desire a less invasive procedure, or
as a first stage to delay surgery in those with more aggressive disease. The
procedure is safe and easily tolerated by patients, but there is a high rate of
recurrence.
