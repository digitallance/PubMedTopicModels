OBJECTIVE: Secondary effects and drug reactions relative to collagenase
Clostridium histolyticum treatment for Dupuytren's contracture are frequent. In
only a few cases these secondary effects are considered serious. The mechanism
that produces these effects of production is not well understood.
CLINICAL REPORT: We present the case report of a woman with fifth finger
interphalangeal joint treatment with generalized skin rash as a complication of
collagenase Clostridium histolyticum treatment.
DISCUSSION: We discuss treatment, causes and mechanisms of this rare complication
from this treatment and review the bibliography about mechanisms for the
different types of immunological reactions that may occur after treatment with
collagenase Clostridium histolyticum and the possibility of crossed reactions
with Clostridiopeptidase A used to treat skin lacerations.
