Ultrasound-Assisted Percutaneous Needle Fasciotomy for Dupuytren's Contracture.

Sakellariou VI, Brault J, Rizzo M.

Although percutaneous needle fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture is a simple, 
inexpensive procedure, it is a blind procedure with risks including injury to
nerves, arteries, and tendons. The authors describe a novel technique using
ultrasound as an adjunct to percutaneous fasciotomy for Dupuytren's contracture. 
Generally, patients have no postoperative restrictions other than to avoid
submerging their hands for 48 hours. To date, the authors have noted, in 66
cases, no permanent complete nerve dysfunction following needle aponeurotomy
using ultrasound assistance. Recurrence of the disease is the most common
complication, occurring at a higher rate than with open procedures. Ultrasound
mapping of the digital neurovascular structures can be successfully used as an
adjunct to help prevent these neurovascular complications.
