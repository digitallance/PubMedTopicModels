PURPOSE: To compare percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) with collagenase
injection in the treatment of Dupuytren contracture.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for patients with Dupuytren disease
treated with PNF or collagenase. Range of motion, patient satisfaction, and
complications were recorded.
RESULTS: There were 29 patients in the collagenase group with mean baseline
contractures of 40° for 22 affected metacarpophalangeal joints and 50° for 12
affected proximal interphalangeal joints. The PNF group was composed of 30
patients with mean baseline contractures of 37° for 32 affected
metacarpophalangeal joints and 41° for 18 affected proximal interphalangeal
joints. All patients were observed for a minimum of 3 months. Clinical success
(reduction of contracture within 0° to 5° of normal) was accomplished in 35 of 50
joints (67%) in the PNF group and in 19 of 34 joints (56%) in the collagenase
group. Patient satisfaction was similar between groups. Only minor complications 
were observed, including skin tears, ecchymosis, edema, pruritus, and
lymphadenopathy.
CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, both PNF and collagenase have similar clinical
outcomes and patient satisfaction.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic III.
