▾Xiapex for Dupuytren's contracture.

[No authors listed]

Dupuytren's contracture is a benign, progressive disabling condition of the
hands. Traditionally, surgery (e.g. fasciotomy, fasciectomy, joint fusion and
amputation) has been the only effective treatment but it is not an option for
every patient. A potential alternative intervention is a formulation of
collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (▾Xiapex--Pfizer Limited), which has been
licensed for injection directly into the affected joint as treatment for adults
with Dupuytren's contracture.5 Here we review the evidence for collagenase C.
histolyticum and discuss its place in the management of this condition.
