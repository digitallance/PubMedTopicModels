BACKGROUND: Many surgical options exist for the treatment of Dupuytren
contracture. Little has been written regarding their financial implications. The 
purpose of this study was to compare the immediate direct costs of open
fasciectomy to percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (NA) for the surgical treatment
of Dupuytren contracture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed comparing patients
treated with open fasciectomy (group 1) to patients treated with percutaneous NA 
(group 2) for the treatment of Dupuytren disease from 2008 to 2010. Financial and
medical records were reviewed. Direct cost of treatment was calculated from
hospital billing records, including surgical, anesthesia, and facility fees.
Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t test.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients received open segmental palmar and/or digital
fasciectomy (group 1). Average preoperative metacarpophalangeal joint flexion
contracture was 30 degrees, and proximal interphalangeal joint flexion
contracture was 42 degrees. Group 2 consisted of 24 patients. Average
preoperative metacarpophalangeal flexion contracture was 31 degrees, and proximal
interphalangeal flexion contracture was 27 degrees. Mean cost for group 1 was
$11,240 and mean cost for group 2 was $4657 (P < 0.0001). Immediate postoperative
contracture correction was similar between both. Two complications occurred in
group 1 (wound dehiscence and nerve injury); no complications in group 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous NA is associated with decreased direct costs in the
short-term compared to traditional open fasciectomy with comparable deformity
correction.
