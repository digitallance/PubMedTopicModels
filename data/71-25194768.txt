PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy, tolerance, and safety of manual manipulation at
day 7 to day 1 following collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection for
Dupuytren contracture.
METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to manipulation at day 1 versus day 7 
following CCH injection. Preinjection, premanipulation, postmanipulation, and
30-day follow-up metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP)
joint contractures were measured. Pain scores were recorded at each time point.
Data were stratified per cohort based on primary joint treated (MCP vs PIP).
Means were compared using paired and unpaired t-tests.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients with 46 digits were eligible and were randomized to
1-day (22 digits) and 7-day (24 digits) manipulation. For MCP joints, there were 
no significant differences in flexion contractures between 1- and 7-day cohorts
for initial (47° vs 46°), postmanipulation (0° vs 2°), or 30-day follow-up (1° vs
2°) measurements. Premanipulation, the residual contracture was significantly
lower in the 7-day group (23° vs 40°). For PIP joints, there were no significant 
differences between 1- and 7-day cohorts for initial (63° vs 62°),
premanipulation (56° vs 52°), postmanipulation (13° vs 15°), or 30-day (14° vs
16°) measurements. There were no significant differences in pain or skin tears
between the 2 groups. No flexor tendon ruptures were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of CCH in achieving correction of Dupuytren
contractures was preserved when manipulation was performed on day 7, with no
differences in correction, pain, or skin tears. These data suggest that
manipulation can be scheduled at the convenience of the patient and surgeon
within the first 7 days after injection.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.
