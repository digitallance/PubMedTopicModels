PURPOSE: The JOINT I (United States) and JOINT II (Australia and Europe) studies 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH)
injection for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture.
METHODS: Both studies used identical open-label protocols. Patients with
fixed-flexion contractures of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) (20° to 100°) or proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints (20° to 80°) could receive up to three 0.58-mg CCH
injections per cord (up to 5 total injections per patient). We performed
standardized finger extension procedures to disrupt injected cords the next day, 
with follow-up 1, 2, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The primary end point (clinical 
success) was reduction in contracture to within 0° to 5° of full extension 30
days after the last injection. Clinical improvement was defined as 50% or more
reduction from baseline contracture.
RESULTS: Dupuytren cords affecting 879 joints (531 MCP and 348 PIP) in 587
patients were administered CCH injections at 14 U.S. and 20 Australian/European
sites, with similar outcomes in both studies. Clinical success was achieved in
497 (57%) of treated joints using 1.2 ± 0.5 (mean ± SD) CCH injections per cord. 
More MCP than PIP joints achieved clinical success (70% and 37%, respectively) or
clinical improvement (89% and 58%, respectively). Less severely contracted joints
responded better than those more severely contracted. Mean change in contracture 
was 55° for MCP joints and 25° for PIP joints. With average contracture
reductions of 73% and improvements in range of motion by 30°, most patients (92%)
were "very satisfied" (71%) or "quite satisfied" (21%) with treatment. Physicians
rated change from baseline as "very much improved" (47%) or "much improved"
(35%). The CCH injections were well tolerated, causing no tendon ruptures or
systemic reactions.
CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum was an effective, minimally
invasive option for the treatment of Dupuytren contracture of a broad range of
severities. Most treated joints (625 of 879) required a single injection.
Treatment earlier in the course of disease provided improved outcomes.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
