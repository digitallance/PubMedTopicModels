AIMS: To observe the natural history of hand function during a two-year period in
participants with hand syndromes associated with diabetes and to determine
factors related to changing function.
METHODS: Hand function was measured over three annual visits using Disability of 
the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) and SF-36v2 questionnaires, grip strength,
light touch and 9-hole peg tests. Light touch was tested with WEST monofilaments 
at 7 sites on the hand (score 35 to 0). Data were analyzed using
repeated-measures ANOVA, Spearman's correlation, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
RESULTS: Participants (n=60) were aged 61 ± 10.5 years, 57% female, diagnosed
with diabetes and at least one of four associated hand disorders. Presentations
of carpal tunnel syndrome, or past release (n=27, 45%) and trigger finger (n=24, 
40%) were common. Tactile sensation was reduced during the two-year period
(median, range; 30 months, 25-40 months). Initial median (inter-quartile range)
scores for the dominant hand of 25.5 (22-28.5) were reduced to 23 (21.5-27). This
sensory loss was weakly associated with HbA1c (r=0.30, p=0.05) and occurred
predominantly in participants with trigger finger (p=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Light touch perception was reduced in longstanding diabetic hand
syndromes. Tactile abnormalities that were detected by clinical examination
progressed during a two year period and were related to metabolic control and
musculoskeletal diagnosis.
