PURPOSE: The brief Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (briefMHQ) was developed 
as a shorter version of the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ), but its
measurement properties have not been investigated in patients with Dupuytren
contracture. The objective of the study was to investigate the reliability,
validity, responsiveness, and interpretability of the briefMHQ.
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients diagnosed with Dupuytren contracture completed the 
briefMHQ as well as the full-length MHQ and Quick Disabilities of the Arm,
Shoulder, and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire at baseline. Two to 14 days after
baseline and 1 year after collagenase injection or surgery, patients again filled
out the briefMHQ. Reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation
coefficient and by calculating internal consistency (Cronbach alpha). Validity
was tested by quantifying correlations with the full-length MHQ and QuickDASH.
Responsiveness, based on the standardized response mean and the minimally
clinically important change, was also determined.
RESULTS: The briefMHQ had an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87, Cronbach
alpha of 0.88, and correlations of r = 0.88 and -0.82 with the original MHQ and
QuickDASH, respectively. The standardized response mean was 0.9 and the minimally
clinically important change was 7 points.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the briefMHQ demonstrates excellent reliability, good
validity, and high responsiveness in patients with Dupuytren contracture.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The briefMHQ is an accurate and time-saving tool to evaluate 
patients with Dupuytren contracture and the effect of a corresponding treatment.
