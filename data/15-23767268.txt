Dupuytren's contracture of the hand is an extremely common deformity in middle
aged and elderly men but it is rarely encountered in women. It usually involves
the fifth and fourth fingers, less commonly the other two fingers, and never the 
thumb. There is a flexion deformity between the head of the metacarpal and the
adjacent proximal phalanx and at the proximal interphalangeal joint. However, the
distal interphalangeal joint is not affected. Indeed, in a severe case, the
distal phalanx may actually be extended as it becomes progressively pressed into 
the palm of the hand. It is often bilateral and may affect the sole of the
foot--although I have only had one old gentleman where his foot lesion troubled
him enough for him to request surgical cure.
