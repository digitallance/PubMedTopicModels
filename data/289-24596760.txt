Giant Cell Tumours Of Tendon Sheath (GCTTS) are the second most frequent soft
tissue tumours affecting the hand with an overall incidence of 1 in 50,000
individuals. These tumours are usually localized and solitary, with multiple
GCTTS occurring rarely. Multi-centric origin is considered unusual and very few
cases of multiple GCTTS have been reported till date. Here, we report a rare case
of a 26-year-old female who presented with multiple painless swellings on palmar 
aspect of little finger of right hand since six months. Clinical diagnosis of
Dupuytren's contracture was given. Intraoperative examination revealed multiple
separate nodules, firmly attached to the flexor tendon synovial sheath.
Histopathology showed features of GCTTS.
