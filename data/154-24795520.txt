BACKGROUND: Palmaris longus, being the most variable muscle of the upper
extremity is generally considered important morphologically rather than
functionally. The palmar aponeurosis represents the distal part of the tendon of 
Palmaris longus.
CASE DETAILS: We report here a unique case of palmaris longus presenting
variation distally as its tendon divides to gain multiple attachments with the
fascia covering the abductor pollicis brevis, flexor retinaculum and the tendon
of flexor carpi ulnaris. In addition, it also continues as palmar aponeurosis as 
its normal course.
CONCLUSION: Presence of this kind of variation might result in compression of the
median and ulnar nerves and may aggravate the complications in case of
inflammation of palmar aponeurosis thus mimicking the manifestations of
Dupuytren's contracture.
