INTRODUCTION: While Dupuytren's disease can cause disabling contractures
requiring open surgery, a less-invasive option using Clostridium Histolyticum
collagenase (CHC) via percutaneous injection was recently reported. A recent
prospective, randomized trial demonstrated few complications during 90 days
follow-up, however did not assess any longer term follow-up for these patients.
Long-term outcomes in this setting have not been adequately reported, and the
current manuscript aims to identify late complications from the clinical use of
percutaneous CHC.
METHODS: The current manuscript reports an extended 12-month follow-up for a
cohort of twelve of patients enrolled in the original prospective, randomized
trial, treated at a single institution. An analysis of complications requiring
surgical intervention was undertaken.
RESULTS: Two of twelve patients reported debilitating pain and triggering
requiring surgical intervention. Extensive deep-tissue scarring and adhesions
were identified, providing the first visual and qualitative analysis of the
pathologic effects of CHC.
CONCLUSION: Late complications from CHC use can and have occurred, outside the
follow-up period of the initial phase III trials. Longer term follow-up of such
patients is thus essential, and further investigation and characterization of the
late effects of CHC use is warranted.
