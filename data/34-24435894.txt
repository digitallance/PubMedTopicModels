OBJECTIVES: To compare collagenase injections and surgery (fasciectomy) for
Dupuytren's contracture (DC) regarding actual total direct treatment costs and
short-term outcomes.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Orthopaedic department of a regional hospital in Sweden.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 65 years or older with previously untreated DC of 30°
or greater in the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP)
joints of the small, ring or middle finger. The collagenase group comprised 16
consecutive patients treated during the first 6 months following the introduction
of collagenase as treatment for DC at the study centre. The controls were 16
patients randomly selected among those operated on with fasciectomy at the same
centre during the preceding 3 years.
INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with collagenase was given during two standard
outpatient clinic visits (injection of 0.9 mg, distributed at multiple sites in a
palpable cord, and next-day finger extension under local anaesthesia) followed by
night-time splinting. Fasciectomy was carried out in the operating room (day
surgery) under general or regional anaesthesia using standard technique, followed
by therapy and splinting.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Actual total direct costs (salaries of
all medical personnel involved in care, medications, materials and other relevant
costs), and total MCP and PIP extension deficit (degrees) measured by hand
therapists at 6-12 weeks after the treatment.
RESULTS: Collagenase injection required fewer hospital outpatient visits to a
therapist and nurse than fasciectomy. Total treatment cost for collagenase
injection was US$1418.04 and for fasciectomy US$2102.56. The post-treatment
median (IQR) total extension deficit was 10 (0-30) for the collagenase group and 
10 (0-34) for the fasciectomy group.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of DC with one collagenase injection costs 33% less than
fasciectomy with equivalent efficacy at 6 weeks regarding reduction in
contracture.
