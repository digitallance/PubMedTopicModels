The object of this study was the investigation of four common variants of single 
nucleotide polymorphisms of the aldehyde dehydrogenase H2 gene and dihydrodiol
dehydrogenase gene and their association with the occurrence of Dupuytren's
disease. DNA samples were obtained from the peripheral blood of 300 consecutive
patients. The control group comprised 300 healthy adults who were age matched
with the Dupuytren's patients. All four common variants were analysed using
TaqManÂ® genotyping assays and sequencing. The differences in the frequencies of
variants of single nucleotide polymorphisms in patients and the control group
were statistically tested. No significant differences were found in the
frequencies of the variants of the aldehyde dehydrogenase H2 and dihydrodiol
dehydrogenase genes between the groups. Likewise, no significant differences were
found in the frequencies of the variants of the genes between men and women. We
noted a statistically significantly higher prevalence of the variants of the
dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene (rs2270941 and rs11666105) in the group with a
positive familial history of Dupuytren's disease, in comparison with the group
with a negative familial history.
