BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Dupuytren's contractures affecting proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints are challenging to treat. We explored the effects of
collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) on PIP joint contractures after
injection of an affected metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint in the same finger and
after injection of an isolated PIP joint contracture.
METHODS: Two patient subsets were evaluated: those with MP/PIP joints
contractures in the same finger, but only the MP joint contractures were treated 
(Group A); and those with isolated PIP joint contractures that were treated
(Group B). Endpoints included correction and improvement in contracture.
Fixed-flexion contracture (FFC) and range of motion (ROM) were also assessed;
adverse events (AEs) were monitored.
RESULTS: In Group A, 28 and 43 % of PIP contractures spontaneously corrected
after the first and last injection of CCH, respectively, for MP contractures; 40 
and 63 %, respectively, improved. In Group B, 31 and 39 % of PIP joint
contractures corrected after the first and last injection of CCH, respectively,
56 and 66 %, respectively, improved. In Groups A and B, FFC improvements were
largest after the last injection; ROM improvements were largest after the last
injection in Group A and third injection in Group B. For 46 and 44 % of patients 
in Groups A and B, respectively, the first injection was the last injection. In
Group B, the median (minimum, maximum) injections/joint was 1.0 (1.0, 4.0).
Nearly all patients (98 %) experienced â‰¥1 AE; most were injection-site reactions.
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of CCH for improving PIP joint contracture was similar 
whether treated in isolation or after treatment of an MP joint contracture.
