BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) is a progressive fibroproliferative
disorder characterized by development of nodules and collagen cords within the
palmar fascia of the hand. Collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) is
currently approved in adults with DC for the nonsurgical treatment of a single
palpable cord during a 30-day treatment cycle. This open-label pilot study was
designed to examine the safety, efficacy, and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of
injecting two cords (affected joints) with multiple doses of CCH concurrently
into the same hand in subjects with DC and multiple contractures.
METHODS: Twelve subjects with DC were enrolled, each with ≥3 contractures caused 
by palpable cords. Efficacy assessments were taken 30 days after treatment and
adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout. In the first treatment period, all
subjects were injected with a single dose of CCH (0.58 mg) into a single cord.
The same subjects entered a second treatment period 30 days later, where two
different cords (affected joints) were injected concurrently on the same hand. A 
finger extension procedure was performed 24 hours after each administration of
CCH to disrupt the enzymatically weakened cord.
RESULTS: For metacarpophalangeal (MP) joints, mean contracture reduction per
joint treated was 29.0 ± 20.7 degrees following single injection vs 30.3 ± 10.9
degrees per treated joint following multiple injections. For proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints, mean reduction in contracture was 30.7 ± 21.1 and
22.1 ± 4.9 degrees per treated joint, respectively, for the two periods. All
patients (100%) were either "quite satisfied" or "very satisfied" following
either treatment cycle. The most common treatment-related AEs were edema
peripheral, contusion, and pain in the treated extremity; the differences in
severity for local effects of the injections were minimal between treatment
periods. No serious treatment-related AEs or systemic complications were
reported.
CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminary evidence that two cords (affected
joints) can be treated concurrently with CCH with similar efficacy and safety as 
cords treated individually in a sequential fashion. Multiple concurrent
injections would eliminate the 30-day wait between single treatments and allow
for rapid and effective treatment of patients with multiple affected joints, a
significant advantage for both patient and physician.
