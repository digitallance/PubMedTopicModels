We aimed to assess the relative contribution of genes and environment in the
aetiology of Dupuytren's disease by studying Danish twins born between 1870 and
2000. Twins with a diagnosis (n = 365) and the subgroup who also had an operation
(n = 259) after 1977 were identified through linkage with a nationwide hospital
registry among 30,330 monozygotic and same-sexed dizygotic twin pairs. Since
monozygotic twins share all their genes and dizygotic twins share on average half
of their genetic material, greater phenotypic similarity is expected in
monozygotic than in dizygotic twins if a genetic component is involved. The
number of concordant male twin pairs with Dupuytren's disease was 17 and 7
(monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, respectively), compared with 60 and 174
discordant monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, yielding probandwise concordance
rates of 0.37 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.26 to 0.50) and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04
to 0.14), respectively. The heritability of Dupuytren's disease was approximately
80%. We conclude that genetic factors play a major role in the development of
Dupuytren's disease.
