BACKGROUND: This study was designed to provide comparative information on the
safety and efficacy of injection with collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) 
and fasciectomy for patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC).
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, observational, longitudinal chart review
was conducted of 25 patients treated with CCH injections and 21 patients
undergoing fasciectomy. Patients were assessed at 1 week, monthly for 3 months
and then yearly for a minimum of 2 years after treatment for changes in
contracture and range of motion, time to return to work/normal activities,
patient satisfaction, and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score.
RESULTS: Post-procedure follow-up averaged 32 months for the injection group
compared with 39 months for fasciectomy group. For the CCH group, the mean
postinjection contracture was 3.6° for the metacarpophalangeal and 17.5° for the 
proximal interphalangeal joints compared with 3.7° and 8.1° in the fasciectomy
group, respectively. Patients treated with injections returned to normal
activities after a mean of 1.9 days compared with 37.4 days for fasciectomy
patients (p < 0.0001). DASH scores for 13 CCH and 15 fasciectomy patients were
obtained. The mean DASH score was significantly lower in the injection group in
the first 3 months (p < 0.01). At the 2-year follow-up visit, patients were
satisfied with their outcomes following either treatment (92 % and 96 % of CCH
and fasciectomy patients, respectively).
CONCLUSION: CCH injections are safe and effective and may be a viable alternative
to fasciectomy for treating DC. It also allows earlier return to work and daily
activities.
