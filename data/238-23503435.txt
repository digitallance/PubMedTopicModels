PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient
satisfaction of multiple needle fasciotomy for Dupuytren disease.
METHODS: During this observational study, patients who underwent the procedure
between 2008 and 2010 were followed up, and outcomes, complications, and patient 
satisfaction were assessed.
RESULTS: Satisfaction rate was 75%, with no postoperative complications noted. As
predicted, early recurrence rate was the main issue with a rate of 28% at the
time of the questionnaire.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy is a safe and efficient procedure in 
treating patients with early Dupuytren or those who would not potentially achieve
good results with more aggressive surgical intervention.
