STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study.
INTRODUCTION: Clinical outcome evaluation needs to consider the patient
perspective for an in-depth understanding of functioning and disability.
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To explore whether patient-reported outcome measures
(PROMs) used in the field of hand injuries or hand disorders, capture functioning
aspects and environmental factors important to the patients.
METHODS: We performed a qualitative study and a systematic literature review. The
focus group sessions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and the identified
concepts were linked to the ICF. We searched in MEDLINE for reviews, related to
injuries or disorders of the hand, reporting on PROMs. We linked the items of the
identified PROMs to the ICF and compared the qualitative data with the content of
the PROMs.
RESULTS: Statements from 45 individuals who participated in eight focus groups
were linked to 97 categories of the ICF. From 15 reviews included, eight PROMs
were selected. The selected PROMs capture 34 of the categories retrieved from the
qualitative data.
CONCLUSIONS: PROMs used in the context of hand injuries or hand disorders capture
only in parts the functioning aspects important to the patients.
