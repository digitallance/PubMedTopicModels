Dupuytren's disease is a common, costly and recurrent health issue. This review
compares Clostridium histolyticum collagenase with current operative treatments. 
Collagenase management is an effective non-surgical alternative associated with
lower risks of serious adverse events, but higher incidence of non-serious
adverse events.
