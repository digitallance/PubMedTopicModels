INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of Dupuytren's disease
in men and its relationship with work exposure, particularly heavy manual work
with and without significant use of vibrating tools, using data from a
surveillance program for musculoskeletal disorders.
METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in France between 2002 and 2005.
Dupuytren's disease was diagnosed clinically by one of 83 occupational
physicians. Exposure in relation to work status and occupational risk factors was
assessed with a self-administered questionnaire, and categorised according to
vibration exposure (defined as use of vibrating tools for ≥2 h/day), heavy manual
work without vibration exposure (defined as use of hand tools for ≥2 h/day (use
of vibrating tools for ≥2 h/day excluded) and Borg scale ≥15/20) and no such
exposure. Bivariate and multivariate associations using logistic models were
recorded in men and in those with >10 years in the same job.
RESULTS: Of 2161 men, 1.3% (n=27) had Dupuytren's disease (mean age 47.1±6.7
years). Heavy manual work without vibration exposure was significantly associated
with the condition (adjusted OR (aOR) 3.9; 95% CI 1.3 to 11.5) adjusted on age
and diabetes), as was use of vibrating tools (aOR 5.1; 2.1 to 12.2). These
associations remained significant among subjects with >10 years in the same job, 
with increases in aOR of 6.1 (1.5 to 25.0) and 10.7 (3.4 to 34.6), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Despite the limited number of cases, occupational exposure, including
both vibration exposure and heavy manual work without significant vibration
exposure, was associated with Dupuytren's disease.
