OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential for treatment of palmar adhesions associated 
with Dupuytren's contracture using instrument-assisted cross-frictional massage
(CFM) and stretching.
METHODS: This was a prospective case study. The primary intervention consisted of
a 2-min multi-planar CFM over the affected area of the palm, followed by a 2-min 
maximal finger-extension stretch.
RESULTS: Following eight weeks of treatment there were increases in both passive 
and active extension range of motion of the digits, reduction in the visibility
of palmar adhesions, and subjective improvements in hand function.
CONCLUSIONS: This treatment protocol may offer a substitute for the current
invasive surgical and injection procedures that are available.
