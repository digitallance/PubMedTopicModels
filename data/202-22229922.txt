Dupuytren's disease is a benign contractile disorder of the hand. The condition
commonly affects older men of Celtic descent. Although fibroproliferation and
collagen alteration play a role in its etiology, defining a cause remains
elusive. Nonoperative intervention for advanced disease has shown only short-term
benefit. Therefore, open fasciectomy has become the mainstay of treatment.
Associated morbidity and recurrence have prompted investigation into less
invasive techniques, including needle aponeurotomy and enzymatic fasciotomy. Data
from phase III studies using injectable collagenase are changing treatment
algorithms. Postoperative rehabilitation includes nighttime splinting and
immediate active range of motion exercises to facilitate return to function.
