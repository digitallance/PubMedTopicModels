BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a benign fibroproliferative
process of the palmar aponeurosis showing similarities to wound healing.
Communication of cells involved in wound healing is mediated by the composition
of gap junction (GJ) proteins. We investigated the expression of 3 GJ proteins,
connexins 26, 30, and 43 (Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43) in DD.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fragments of Dupuytren's tissue from 31 patients (mean age 
56 (30-76) years, 24 male) were analyzed immunohistochemically and compared to
control tissue for expression of the GJ proteins Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43 and also
alfa-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA).
RESULTS: 14 of 31 samples could be attributed to the involutional phase (α-SMA
positive) whereas 17 samples had to be considered cords in the residual phase
(α-SMA negative). Expression of Cx26 and Cx43 was seen in 12 of the 14 samples
from the involutional phase, and Cx30 was seen in 7 of these. Only 4 of the 17
samples from the residual phase showed any Cx, and there was none in the
controls.
INTERPRETATION: The high expression of GJ proteins Cx26, Cx30, and Cx43 in α-SMA 
positive myofibroblast-rich nodules, which are characteristic of the active
involutional phase of DD, suggests that connexins could be a novel treatment
target for the treatment of DD.
