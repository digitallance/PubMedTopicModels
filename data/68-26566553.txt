Collagenase enzymatic fasciotomy is an accepted nonsurgical treatment for
disabling hand contractures caused by Dupuytren disease. We conducted a study to 
investigate use of collagenase in an immunosuppressed population. We
retrospectively reviewed data from 2 academic hand surgical practices. Eight
patients on chronic immunosuppressive therapies were treated with collagenase for
digital contractures between 2010 and 2011. Thirteen collagenase enzymatic
fasciotomies were performed in these 8 patients. Mean preinjection contracture
was 53.0°. At mean follow-up of 6.7 months, mean magnitude of contracture
improved to 12.9°. Mean metacarpophalangeal joint contracture improved from 42.0°
to 4.2°. Mean proximal interphalangeal joint contracture improved from 65.8° to
21.7°. Three of the enzymatic fasciotomies were complicated by skin tears. There 
were no infections. As more patients seek nonsurgical treatment for Dupuytren
disease, its safety and efficacy in select cohorts of patients should continue to
be evaluated prospectively.
