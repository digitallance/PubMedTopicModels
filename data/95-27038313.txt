INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the efficacy of open partial aponeurectomy for
recurrent Dupuytren's contracture.
METHODS: Eighteen patients with recurrent Dupuytren's contracture of 22 fingers
were retrospectively assessed with a mean follow-up time of 94 months (range:
70-114 months). Examination parameters included the determination of range of
motion (ROM), grip strength, pain and subjective outcome (disabilities of the
arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire).
SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: Dissection with special regard to former skin incision and
expected wound defect. Modified incisions after Bruner (Mini-Bruner incisions)
were facilitated. Dissection started at the palm. Fibrous tissue was resected
proximally within the palm including vertical fibrotic septae. Direct preparation
of the neurovascular bundles (NVB) was facilitated from proximal to distal. If
the anatomy of the neurovascular structures became unclear around the natatory
ligament preparation of the NVB at the distal end of the fibrous cord was
performed. After complete preparation of a NVB, dissection was continued from
medial to lateral until the other bundle was completely released. Transposition
flaps and skin transplants were often used for sufficient wound closure.
RESULTS: Recurrence rate was 36 % applying the definition of van Rijssen et al.
Fifteen patients had a grip strength of 90 % or higher in comparison to the
contralateral side. Ten patients had a pinch strength of 90 % or higher in
comparison to the contralateral side. All patients except for one had pain
reduction or none postoperatively. Fifteen patients had a DASH score of 15 or
lower (range: 0-47). An unrelated ray amputation was suffered due to wound
healing complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Open partial aponeurectomy performed by a board certified hand
surgeon proved to be safe. The postoperative functional outcome seemed to be
related to the individual course of the disease.
