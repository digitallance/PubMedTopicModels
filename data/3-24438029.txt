BACKGROUND: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) is a minimally invasive
technique used to manage Dupuytren's contracture. We compared outcomes of PNF
versus open fasciectomy (OF) to examine the suitability of PNF in Australia.
METHOD: A retrospective cohort study using two questionnaires regarding
Dupuytren's treatment was used to assess patients with uncomplicated primary
disease. The primary outcomes were immediate and medium-term correction of
contracture (2-year mean follow-up to time of survey). Secondary outcomes were
patient satisfaction and complications including tendon/nerve injury, infection, 
skin necrosis and vascular damage.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five out of 191 surveys were returned (81%). The final
analysis included 125 cases (65%), 73 PNF and 52 OF. No significant differences
were observed between both groups with regards to follow-up time, gender, smoking
status, co-morbidities or preoperative deformity grade. No significant
differences were observed in terms of immediate or medium-term deformity
correction, tendon/nerve injury or circulatory complications. The postoperative
infection rate was higher with OF, with these patients 7.57 (95% confidence
interval 1.56, 36.77; P = 0.01) times as likely to have a postoperative infection
as patients undergoing PNF. A higher number of patients who underwent PNF were
told that they would require another operation (30% versus 12%; P = 0.02).
Satisfaction scores were similar (OF 33.2 versus PNF 32.6; P = 0.82).
CONCLUSION: The OF and PNF procedures provide comparable deformity correction for
uncomplicated primary Dupuytren's disease in the immediate perioperative period. 
The reduced side effect profile of PNF should prompt surgeons to consider
incorporating it in their practice for the first-line management of uncomplicated
primary Dupuytren's disease.
