Most hand traumas and elective surgical disorders of the hand can be treated
quickly, easily, inexpensively, and effectively in an outpatient clinic. Although
many surgeons prefer general anesthesia, the senior author routinely uses local
anesthesia without sedation almost exclusively for carpal and cubital tunnel
release, fasciectomy, arthrodesis, arthroplasty, synovectomy, and trauma,
including the repair of tendons, nerves, ligaments, fractures, and soft tissue
defects. After completing more than 10,000 procedures, the authors have found
great benefits through the use of local anesthesia, which are detailed in the
article.
