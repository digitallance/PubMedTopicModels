BACKGROUND: Primary frozen shoulder (FS) is a painful contracture of the
glenohumeral joint that arises spontaneously without an obvious preceding event. 
Investigation of the intra-articular and periarticular pathology would contribute
to the treatment of primary FS.
REVIEW OF LITERATURE: Many studies indicate that the main pathology is an
inflammatory contracture of the shoulder joint capsule. This is associated with
an increased amount of collagen, fibrotic growth factors such as transforming
growth factor-beta, and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis
factor-alpha and interleukins. Immune system cells such as B-lymphocytes,
T-lymphocytes and macrophages are also noted. Active fibroblastic proliferation
similar to that of Dupuytren's contracture is documented. Presence of
inflammation in the FS synovium is supported by the synovial enhancement with
dynamic magnetic resonance study in the clinical setting.
CONCLUSION: Primary FS shows fibrosis of the joint capsule, associated with
preceding synovitis. The initiator of synovitis, however, still remains unclear. 
Future studies should be directed to give light to the pathogenesis of
inflammation to better treat or prevent primary FS.
