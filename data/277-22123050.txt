Diabetes mellitus is associated with the development of several pathologic
conditions of the hand, including carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren disease,
trigger digits, and limited joint mobility or cheiroarthropathy. In recent years,
across a variety of surgical disciplines, increased emphasis has been placed on
the impact of diabetes on treatment outcomes. This review provides an overview of
the current literature regarding the effect of diabetes on outcomes of hand
surgery for these common diabetes-related conditions. Taken as a whole, the best 
current evidence supports the efficacy of surgical interventions for the
management of these conditions in diabetic individuals; however, additional
research is required to determine whether the treatment outcomes are equivalent
to those of nondiabetic patients, and whether diabetes is associated with an
increased risk of complications.
