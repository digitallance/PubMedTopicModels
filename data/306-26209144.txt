Ray Resections of the Fingers: Indications, Techniques, and Outcomes.

Blazar PE, Garon MT.

Ray resection, which was pioneered by Bunnell in the 1920s, was initially
performed as a salvage procedure for dysfunction of the proximal interphalangeal 
joint. Successful ray resection with or without an adjacent ray transfer can be
useful for treating vascular insufficiency, tumors, infection, trauma, recurrent 
Dupuytren contracture, and congenital abnormalities of the hand. Indications,
techniques, and outcomes vary based on the digit and the number of digits
resected. Compared with amputation at the proximal phalangeal level, a single ray
resection has better cosmesis and similar function, resulting in improved patient
satisfaction. However, a 15% to 30% loss in grip and pinch strength has been
reported. Today, ray resection results in good cosmetic and functional outcomes
when preservation of a functional digit is unattainable or when the presence of
an abnormal, unreconstructable digit interferes with the overall hand function.
