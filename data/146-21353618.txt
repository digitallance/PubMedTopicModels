AIM: To assess the safety and efficacy of multi-needle aponeurotomy (MNA) for
advanced Duputren's disease.
METHODS: This prospective study included patients with age more than 17 years,
Dupuytren's contracture with palmo-digital or poly-digital involvement, presumed 
NA number needed to treat>4, and availability for at least 1-month follow-up
after MNA. Outcome measures were Tubiana score and passive extension deficit,
after MNA and at 1 and 6 months; self-assessed disability and satisfaction at 1
and 6 months; and adverse events (AEs).
RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. MNA was performed on 37 hands and 99
rays. Among 25 assessed MNA sessions for treatment-related discomfort, patients
considered 22 (88%) not at all to moderately painful. Six minor AEs, representing
2 for every 100 NAs, were reported. Tubiana scores at baseline (5.3±2.3, n=35)
were improved after treatment (1.7±1.8, n=32, P<0.0001), at 1 month (2.2±1.4,
n=26, P<0.0001) and at 6 months (2.8±2.7, n=19, P<0.01). Passive extension
deficit was greatly reduced after treatment and persisted at follow-up.
Disability scores at baseline (27.6±26.9, n=37) were reduced at 1 month
(13.2±19.5, n=26, P=0.02) and at 6 months (5.2±11.6, n=20, P<0.001). Patients
were highly satisfied at 1 month (100%, n=25) and 6 months (95%, n=19).
CONCLUSION: MNA appears safe and effective for advanced Dupuytren's disease. It
could become a treatment of reference and contribute to reducing the need for
surgery in this indication.
