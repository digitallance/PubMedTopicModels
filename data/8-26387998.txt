BACKGROUND: A comparative study between two treatment methods (collagenase
injection and open partial fasciectomy) for Dupuytren's contracture. This study
will determine differences in clinical outcome, complication rate and patient
satisfaction.
METHODS: 37 patients with 62 metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) and 44 proximal
interphalangeal joints (PIP) treated. There were 21 MCP joints (34%) and 8 PIP
joints (18%) treated with injection. The remaining 66% of MCP joints and 82% of
PIP joints were treated by open partial fasciectomy.
RESULTS: Overall, both treatment methods were successful in correcting the
passive extension deficit in the MCP and PIP joints. Minor complications were
reported in 45% of patients in the injection group versus 42% in the surgery
group. Patient satisfaction was nearly equal for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Both treatment options have proven their effectiveness in treating
Dupuytren's contracture. Open surgery is able to address additional joint
contracture problems commonly associated with Dupuytren's disease. Collagenase
injection has the advantage of early return of hand function and avoidance of
surgical complications.
