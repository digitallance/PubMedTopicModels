Palmodigital fasciectomy remains the gold standard. The initial outcome is, in my
experience, far more predictable than either NA or enzyme fasciotomy (EF). It is 
also a more durable treatment. NA and EF can be conceptualized as similar
procedures--one uses a needle and the other an enzyme to weaken a cord sufficient
to be able to rupture it and thus straighten a contracted joint. Both are less
invasive and the hand is quick to recover. Both procedures are equally initially 
effective. CHH seems to offer greater durability. Today’s patients are often
better educated and seek a specific type of treatment, in particular, effective
nonoperative treatment. Pharmaceutical companies now market directly and
effectively to patients, and this strategy and Internet use have already resulted
in an increase in the number of patients searching for practitioners willing to
administer and capable of administering collagenase treatment.
