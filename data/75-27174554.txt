OBJECTIVES: Injectable Bromelain Solution (IBS) is a modified investigational
derivate of the medical grade bromelain-debriding pharmaceutical agent (NexoBrid)
studied and approved for a rapid (four-hour single application), eschar-specific,
deep burn debridement. We conducted an ex vivo study to determine the ability of 
IBS to dissolve-disrupt (enzymatic fasciotomy) Dupuytren's cords.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specially prepared medical grade IBS was injected into
fresh Dupuytren's cords excised from patients undergoing surgical fasciectomy.
These cords were tested by tension-loading them to failure with the Zwick 1445
(Zwick GmbH & Co. KG, Ulm, Germany) tension testing system.
RESULTS: We completed a pilot concept-validation study that proved the efficacy
of IBS to induce enzymatic fasciotomy in ten cords compared with control in ten
cords. We then completed a dosing study with an additional 71 cords injected with
IBS in descending doses from 150 mg/cc to 0.8 mg/cc. The dosing study
demonstrated that the minimal effective dose of 0.5 cc of 6.25 mg/cc to 5 mg/cc
could achieve cord rupture in more than 80% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results indicate that IBS may be effective in
enzymatic fasciotomy in Dupuytren's contracture.Cite this article: Dr G. Rubin. A
