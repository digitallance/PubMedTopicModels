BACKGROUND: Checkrein ligament release for treatment of proximal interphalangeal 
joint Dupuytren contractures does not address the shortened arteries or deficient
skin. The Digit Widget uses soft-tissue distraction to overcome these issues.
This study compares checkrein ligament release after fasciectomy versus
preliminary soft-tissue distraction, followed by operative release, for treatment
of proximal interphalangeal joint Dupuytren contractures.
METHODS: The authors compared operative and postoperative characteristics of
patients treated with either fasciectomy plus checkrein ligament release or Digit
Widget distraction between 2001 and 2008. Seventeen patients (20 digits)
underwent ligament release (mean contracture, 55.9 degrees); six of these 20 were
reoperations. Thirteen patients (17 digits) underwent distraction (mean
contracture, 67.6 degrees); 10 of 17 were reoperations.
RESULTS: The 20 digits treated with fasciectomy plus ligament release had an
average extension improvement of 31.4 degrees (range, -4 to 70 degrees). Digits
treated with distraction had an average extension improvement of 53.4 degrees
(range, 30 to 75 degrees) (p<0.001 versus ligament release). Three digits treated
with distraction improved to full proximal interphalangeal extension. Initial
contractures of 60 degrees or less treated by ligament release (n=12) or
distraction (n=7) improved by means of 28.8 degrees and 47.7 degrees,
respectively (p=0.048). Contractures greater than 60 degrees treated by ligament 
release (n=8) or distraction (n=10) improved by means of 35.3 degrees and 57.3
degrees, respectively (p=0.02).
CONCLUSION: Soft-tissue distraction followed by operative release showed greater 
correction than Dupuytren fasciectomy plus checkrein ligament release.
