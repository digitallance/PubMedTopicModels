Dupuytren's contracture is believed to be rare in Africa. We have observed the
disease in many patients coming to our hospital. This study aimed to provide
information concerning the occurrence of the disease and risk factors in these
patients. All 75 patients who were referred to the hospital during a 2-year
period because of a hand problem that was diagnosed as Dupuytren's contracture
were included. The demographic data of the patients and possible risk factors
were recorded and compared with a control group. The male to female ratio was
18:1. The little and ring fingers were most commonly affected. A total of 43 had 
bilateral hand involvement. The condition affected only the left hand in one
patient. Six men also had fibromatosis of the soles of the feet and three of the 
penis. There was a statistically significant association with hypertension and
alcohol consumption, but not with diabetes mellitus. We conclude that there are
more cases of Dupuytren's contracture in Ethiopia than previously thought.LEVEL
