Collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) injection is a nonoperative treatment 
of hand contractures from Dupuytren disease. This study assessed the efficacy and
safety of CCH in several subgroups of patients with increased surgical risk.Data 
were pooled from 3 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials. This
analysis included 271 patients with metacarpophalangeal (n = 167) or proximal
interphalangeal (n = 104) joint contractures greater than or equal to 20 degrees 
treated with CCH (0.58 mg collagenase per injection). Subgroups included age,
sex, and diabetes status. End points included rate of clinical success (reduction
in contracture to 0-5 degrees of normal) and percentage of adverse events.There
was no significant difference in clinical success by age, diabetes status, or sex
with 63% reaching the end point. There was no difference in adverse events among 
the subgroups, with peripheral edema, contusion, and injection-site hemorrhage
being most common.High-risk subgroups do not demonstrate differences in efficacy 
or safety with CCH treatment of Dupuytren-related contractures.
