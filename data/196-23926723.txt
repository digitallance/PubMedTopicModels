Despite its high prevalence, the clinical presentation and severity of Dupuytren 
disease is extremely variable. The disease features a broad spectrum of symptoms,
from simple nodules without the slightest clinical impact towards an extremely
disabling form requiring multiple surgical procedures, sometimes even partial
hand amputations. Recurrence after surgery is considered a failure for both
patient and surgeon, but its definition is vague. The term 'recontracture' was
coined by a patient and reflects the disappointment of recurrent disease. Wether 
or not a treatment option will insure a definite result, may depend more on the
severity of the disease, which is patient specific, than on the treatment method 
itself. If a patient presents with Dupuytren disease, one should not merely
evaluate his hands. Different clinical and personal history features may uncover 
a severe fibrosis diathesis and both correct information to the patient and an
individualized treatment plan are needed. In the near future, a simple genetic
test may help to identify patients at risk. Similar to the evolving knowledge and
treatment modalities seen in rheumatoid arthritis, treatment of Dupuytren disease
is likely to advance in the direction of disease control with pharmacotherapy and
single shot minimal invasive enzymatic fasciotomy with collagenase to correct
established contractures.
