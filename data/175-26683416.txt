OBJECTIVE: Nonsurgical treatment of Dupuytren's disease using collagenase
Clostridium histolyticum (CCH).
INDICATIONS: Metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint (20-100°) and proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joint (20-80°) contractures.
CONTRAINDICATIONS: Pregnancy, previous hypersensitivity to collagenase or
excipients, anticoagulant use within 7 days prior to treatment.
INJECTION TECHNIQUE: CCH injected directly into the Dupuytren's cord weakening
the contracted cord. After injection, the patient returns the following day to
allow CCH to lyse the collagen within the cord. An extension force is then
applied to the involved finger to disrupt the weakened cord.
POSTMANIPULATION MANAGEMENT: Use of extension splint at night, movement
instructions during the day.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (107 men; 13 women; mean age 62 years, range
30-84 years) were treated. In 49% the little finger, in 44% the ring finger, in
4% the middle finger, and in 3% the index finger was treated. Full release was
achieved in 71%, partial release in 26%, and no change in 3% of patients. The
median pretreatment contracture for the MP joint was 37° (range 25-100°) and PIP 
joint 51° (range 30-97°). At 12 months, the mean contracture for the MP joint was
9° (range 0-25°) and for the PIP joint 21° (range 10-36°). Adverse events
observed in 96% of patients for 3 months . No tendon ruptures, anaphylactic
reactions, or nerve or ligament injuries observed.
