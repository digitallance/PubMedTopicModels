OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to describe hospitalization for treatment
of Dupuytren's disease in France between 2002 and 2009.
METHODS: A repeated, annual, cross-sectional national survey of public and
private French hospitals was performed between 2002 and 2009, with planned
selection criteria for data extraction. Outcomes were age, sex, number of
hospitalizations, length of stays, and types of surgical procedure. Types of
surgical procedure included aponeurectomy, aponeurotomy, transplantation (skin
graft), arthrolysis, amputation, arthrodesis, combined procedures.
RESULTS: The selected hospital stays represented 95% to 97% of all stays with
Dupuytren's disease coded as the primary diagnosis. The hospitalizations involved
mainly men in the 7th decade. The mean number of hospitalizations for Dupuytren's
disease was 16,487, for between 7 and 8/10,000 total hospitalizations each year. 
Most of the hospitalizations for Dupuytren's disease were one-day stays in
private settings. Over time, the mean length of hospital stay significantly
shortened and the proportion of one-day stays significantly increased.
Aponeurectomy was the most reported treatment. The distribution of aponeurectomy 
of 1 finger or ≥ 2 fingers was balanced. The performance of arthrolysis,
transplantation, amputation and arthrodesis was low.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite of shortening of hospitals stays over time, hospitalization 
for surgery for Dupuytren's disease in France still represents a meaningful
economic burden.
