AIM: We explored regional variations in the surgical management of patients with 
Dupuytren's contracture (DC) in 12 European countries using a surgeon survey and 
patient chart review.
METHODS: Twelve countries participated: Denmark, Finland, Sweden (Nordic region);
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland (East); France, Germany, the Netherlands, UK
(West); Italy, Spain (Mediterranean). For the survey, a random sample of
orthopaedic/plastic surgeons (n = 687) with 3-30 years' experience was asked
about DC procedures performed during the previous 12 months. For the chart review
(n = 3357), information from up to five consecutive patients was extracted.
Descriptive statistics are reported.
RESULTS: Ninety-five per cent of all surgeons used fasciectomy for DC, followed
by fasciotomy (70%), dermofasciectomy (38%) and percutaneous needle fasciotomy
(35%). Most surgeons were satisfied with fasciectomy over other procedures.
Recommended time away from work and duration of physical therapy increased with
the invasiveness of the procedure. The intra-operative complication rate was
4.0%; the postoperative complication rate was 34%. Overall, ≥ 97% of the
procedures were rated by surgeons as having a positive outcome. Across all
regions, 54% of patients had no nodules or contracture after the procedures. Only
2% of patients required retreatment within the first year of surgery. Important
inter- and intraregional differences in these aspects of patient management are
described.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding current regional treatment patterns and their
relationships to country-specific health systems may facilitate earlier
identification of, and intervention for, DD and help to optimise the overall
treatment for patients with this chronic condition.
