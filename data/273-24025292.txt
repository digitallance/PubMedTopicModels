INTRODUCTION: Patient reported outcome measures are central to National Health
Service quality of care assessments. This study investigated the benefit of
elective hand surgery by the simultaneous analysis of pain, function and
appearance, using a three-dimensional (3D) graphical model for evaluating and
presenting outcome.
METHODS: A total of 188 patients scheduled for surgery completed pre- and
postoperative questionnaires grading the severity of their pain, dysfunction and 
deformity of their hand(s). Scores were plotted on a 3D graph to demonstrate the 
degree of 'normalisation' following surgery.
RESULTS: Surgical groups included: nerve compression (n=53), Dupuytren's disease 
(n=51), trigger finger (n=20), ganglion (n=17) or other lump (n=21),
trapeziometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (n=10), rheumatoid disease (n=5) and
other pathology (n=13). A significant improvement towards normality was seen
after surgery in each group except for patients with rheumatoid disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a simple, visual representation of hand surgery 
outcome by plotting patient scores for pain, function and appearance
simultaneously on a 3D graph.
