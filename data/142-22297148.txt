Dupuytren's disease is a fibroproliferative disease of the palmar fascia which
has been described for centuries, yet the aetiology and pathophysiology remain
poorly understood. Surgery and collagenase injections comprise the main
therapeutic options but disease recurrence is common. We explore the evidence
underlying the current disease theories and outline other potential therapeutic
options.
