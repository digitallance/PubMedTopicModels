Dupuytren disease, a clinical entity originally described more than 400 years
ago, is a progressive disease of genetic origin. Excessive myofibroblast
proliferation and altered collagen matrix composition lead to thickened and
contracted palmar fascia; the resultant digital flexion contractures may severely
limit function. The pathophysiology is multifactorial and remains a topic of
research and debate. Genetic predisposition, trauma, inflammatory response,
ischemia, and environment, as well as variable expression of proteins and growth 
factors within the local tissue, all play a role in the disease process. Common
treatments of severe disease include open fasciectomy or fasciotomy. These
procedures may be complicated by the complex anatomic relationships between cords
(pathologic contracted fascia) and adjacent neurovascular structures. Recent
advances in the management of Dupuytren disease involve less invasive treatments,
such as percutaneous needle fasciotomy and injectable collagenase Clostridium
histolyticum. Postoperative management focuses on minimizing the cellular
response of cord disruption and maximizing range of motion through static or
dynamic extension splinting.
