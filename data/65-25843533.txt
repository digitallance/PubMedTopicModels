PURPOSE: To examine the results of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint
contractures from 4 phase 3 clinical trials of collagenase clostridium
histolyticum (CCH) injection for Dupuytren contracture.
METHODS: Patients enrolled in Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren I/II 
and JOINT I/II with one or more PIP joint contractures (20° to 80°) received CCH 
0.58 mg/0.20 mL or placebo (Collagenase Option for Reduction of Dupuytren I/II
only) injected directly into a palpable cord. The percentage of PIP joints
achieving clinical success (0° to 5° of full extension), clinical improvement
(50% or more reduction in baseline contracture), and range of motion improvement 
at 30 days after the first and last CCH injections was assessed. The PIP joint
contractures were classified into low (40° or less) and high (more than 40°)
baseline severity. Adverse events were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 506 adults (mean age, 63 ± 10 y; 80% male) received 1,165 CCH
injections in 644 PIP joint cords (mean, 1.6 injections/cord). Most patients
(60%) received 1 injection, with 24%, 16%, and 1% receiving 2, 3, and 4
injections, respectively. Clinical success and clinical improvement occurred in
27% and 49% of PIP joints after one injection and in 34% and 58% after the last
injection. Patients with lower baseline severity showed greater improvement and
response was comparable between fingers, as were improvements in range of motion.
Adverse events occurring in more than 10% of patients were peripheral edema
(58%), contusion (38%), injection site hemorrhage (23%), injection site pain
(21%), injection site swelling (16%), and tenderness (13%). This incidence was
consistent with data reported in phase 3 trials. Two tendon ruptures occurred. No
further ruptures occurred after a modified injection technique was adopted.
CONCLUSIONS: Collagenase clostridium histolyticum was effective and well
tolerated in the short term in patients with Dupuytren PIP joint contractures.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic II.
