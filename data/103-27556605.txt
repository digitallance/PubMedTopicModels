BACKGROUND: This study examined patient satisfaction with hand function after
fasciectomy for Dupuytren's contracture and determined which preoperative
patient- and disease-specific factors predicted this satisfaction.
METHODS: Demographics and disease-specific factors were assessed from a
prospective cohort of 194 patients who completed the Michigan Hand Outcomes
Questionnaire preoperatively and underwent limited fasciectomy between 2011 and
2014 at six hand surgery practice sites. To evaluate satisfaction with hand
function, patients were asked to complete the Michigan Hand Outcomes
Questionnaire during the first year after fasciectomy. After patients were
classified into a satisfied and an unsatisfied category using the question that
specifically pertains to satisfaction with hand function, the authors applied
multivariate logistic regression modeling to identify independent predictors of
patient satisfaction.
RESULTS: At an average of 10 months (range, 6 to 12 months) after fasciectomy, 84
percent (n = 163) of the patients were satisfied with their hand function. In
multivariate analyses adjusting for the degree of postoperative residual
contracture (p < 0.001) and complications (p < 0.001), a higher preoperative
Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire hand appearance subscore and male gender
predicted a higher likelihood of becoming satisfied after fasciectomy. Other
patient- and disease-specific factors did not show evidence for an association
with patient satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that providers should consider
assessing concerns about the appearance of the hand in patients with Dupuytren's 
contracture. They also highlight the importance of complication prevention and
full contracture correction from the patient's perspective.
