INTRODUCTION: Peyronie's disease (PD) is a fibromatosis of the penis, with a
pathology very similar to what is seen in the hand (palmar fascia) in Dupuytren's
disease (DD). Recently, we performed a genome-wide association study and
identified nine genetic loci containing common variants associated with DD. Seven
of these loci mapped within or near genes of the canonical WNT pathway and each
locus yielded relatively large odds ratios (ORs) for DD disease status.
AIM: Given the clinical overlap between PD and DD, we examined whether the nine
DD susceptibility loci are also involved in PD.
METHODS: An association study was performed using a case/control design. From
2007 to 2010, we prospectively included 111 men who had been clinically diagnosed
with PD. Control subjects (N = 490 males) were randomly drawn from a
population-based cohort from the same region of the Netherlands. Allele
frequencies in the 111 PD cases and 490 controls were compared using a
1-degree-of-freedom basic chi-square test. A P value < 0.05 after Bonferroni
correction for the nine tested single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was
considered statistically significant (i.e., P < 0.0056).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Association of genetic markers (SNPs) with PD.
RESULTS: We observed significant association with SNP rs4730775 at the
wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 2 (WNT2) locus on chromosome 7 
(P = 0.0015, OR 0.61), but found no evidence for the other eight loci being
involved with PD despite the large effect size seen for some of these variants in
DD. The WNT2 association was even more significant after we removed 15 patients
with comorbid DD.
CONCLUSIONS: WNT2 is a susceptibility locus for PD and our finding provides
evidence for a partly shared genetic susceptibility between PD and DD.
