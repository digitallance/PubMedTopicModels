Palmaris longus, phylogenetically a retrogressive muscle, exhibits significant
anatomical variations compared to other muscles of the upper extremity. It is of 
great surgical importance because, it is the first option tendon for graft
procedures in various cosmetic, plastic and reconstructive surgeries. It has also
been widely used in various tendon transfer procedures in treating facial
paralysis, ptosis correction, lip augmentation and digital pulley reconstruction.
We report a rare variant pattern of Palmaris longus with duplicated tendons and
with multiple insertions to thenar and hypothenar muscles, fasciae and the flexor
retinaculum along with its normal continuation as palmar aponeurosis. Variations 
in its insertions not only contribute, but also augment the various pathological 
processes such as Dupuytren's contracture, Carpal tunnel and Guyon's syndromes.
So it is of utmost importance for surgeons, physicians and radiologists, to be
aware of these variations, well in advance.
