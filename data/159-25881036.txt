BACKGROUND: The epidemiologic profile of ethnic Chinese patients with Dupuytren's
disease is unknown. We therefore investigated the epidemiology of Dupuytren's
disease using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database.
METHODS: Patients who filed claims for treatment for Dupuytren's disease between 
January 2000 and December 2011 were identified in the database. Age- and
gender-specific incidences were estimated by dividing the incidence number by
population data.
RESULTS: We identified 1,078 patients with Dupuytren's disease (681 men, 397
women; male/female ratio: 1:1.72). The annual incidence rate ranged from
0.39-0.63/10(5) for men and 0.14-0.44/10(5) for women. A trend analysis revealed 
a rising trend in the annual incidence from 2001 to 2011 (p = 0.0199). The
prevalence rate increased steadily from 0.46/10(5) in 2000 to 4.52/10(5) in 2011 
(p = 0.0186). The mean age at onset was significantly higher in men than in women
(60.7 ± 18.4 vs. 53.7 ± 15.5 years). Peak age at onset for men was 70-79 (28.1%) 
and for women was 50-59 (33.5%). Men > 60 years old had higher incidence rates
than did women (incidence rate ratios: 2.0, 4.5, and 6.6 for those 60-69, 70-79, 
and ≥ 80, respectively). Hypertension (29.6%), diabetes mellitus (21.9%),
hyperlipidemia (14.8%), ischemic heart disease (10.5%), and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (8.0%) were the most common comorbidities.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence of Dupuytren's disease and the
male/female ratio were significantly lower in ethnic Chinese than in Western
ethnic groups. Moreover, the age at onset was significantly lower in ethnic
Chinese women. However, the incidences of three comorbidities (hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia) were similar to those in other
ethnicities.
