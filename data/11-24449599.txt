AIMS: The relation between Dupuytren's contracture and occupational exposure to
hand-transmitted vibration (HTV) has frequently been debated. We explored
associations in a representative national sample of workers with
well-characterised exposure to HTV.
METHODS: We mailed a questionnaire to 21 201 subjects aged 16-64 years, selected 
at random from the age-sex registers of 34 general practices in Great Britain and
to 993 subjects chosen randomly from military pay records, asking about
occupational exposure to 39 sources of HTV and about fixed flexion contracture of
the little or ring finger. Analysis was restricted to men at work in the previous
week. Estimates were made of average daily vibration dose (A(8) root mean squared
velocity (rms)) over that week. Associations with Dupuytren's contracture were
estimated by Poisson regression, for lifetime exposure to HTV and for exposures
in the past week >A(8) of 2.8 ms(-2) rms. Estimates of relative risk (prevalence 
ratio (PR)) were adjusted for age, smoking status, social class and certain
manual activities at work.
RESULTS: In all 4969 eligible male respondents supplied full information on the
study variables. These included 72 men with Dupuytren's contracture, 2287 with
occupational exposure to HTV and 409 with A(8)>2.8 ms(-2) in the past week. PRs
for occupational exposure to HTV were elevated 1.5-fold. For men with an A(8)>2.8
ms(-2) in the past week, the adjusted PR was 2.85 (95% CI 1.37 to 5.97).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that risk of Dupuytren's contracture is more
than doubled in men with high levels of weekly exposure to HTV.
