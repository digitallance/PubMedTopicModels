This study presents the clinical outcomes of 35 hands with Dupuytren's Disease
treated with the McCash technique between 1990 and 2009. Of the 31 patients (28
males and three females, mean age 53 yrs), four patients had bilateral
involvement (12.9%). Thirty hands had no previous medical or surgical treatment
for the disease, while the remaining five hands had been operated on at least
once. The mean contracture of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint improved from
42.14째 to 1.83째, while that of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint improved 
from 62.60째 to 7.09째. All wounds healed within a mean 9.8 weeks. Sensory
evaluation revealed no permanent numbness. With realistic expectations, clear
documentation, meticulous surgical technique and implementation of a demanding
post-operative rehabilitation program, an acceptable outcome may be achieved with
the McCash technique for Dupuytren's disease.
