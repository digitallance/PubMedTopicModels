LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able 
to: (1) Describe features and clinical importance of Dupuytren diathesis. (2)
Explain the difference between the new definition of recurrence used in
collagenase studies compared with prior definitions of recurrence. (3) Compare
and list the main advantage/main disadvantage of fasciectomy versus minimally
invasive treatment (collagenase injection or needle aponeurotomy) of Dupuytren
contracture.
SUMMARY: The large body of existing literature on Dupuytren disease is spread
across many journals in many specialties. It is thus a daunting task for
practitioners to follow trends and practice recommendations. It is also a
testimony to the lack of an acceptable solution to this common problem. Recent
publications provide evidence to highlight controversies and challenge some
traditional teachings. Literature from 2010 to 2012 was reviewed with the intent 
of clarifying some of these issues.
