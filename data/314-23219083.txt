This article reviews the underlying anatomy of trigger finger and thumb (fibrous 
digital pulleys, sesamoid bones), flexor tenosynovitis, de Quervain's syndrome,
Dupuytren's contracture, some hand deformities in rheumatoid arthritis, the
carpal tunnel syndrome and the ulnar nerve compression at Guyon's canal. Some
important syndromes and structures have not been included but such are the nature
of these seminars. Rather than being complete, we aim at creating a system in
which clinical cases are used to highlight the pertinent anatomy and, in the most
important part of the seminar, these pertinent items are demonstrated by cross
examination of participants and teachers. Self learning is critical for
generating interest and expanding knowledge of clinical anatomy. Just look at
your own hand in various positions, move it, feel it, feel also your forearms
while you move the fingers, do this repeatedly and inquisitively and after a few 
tries you will have developed not only a taste, but also a lifelong interest in
clinical anatomy.
