OBJECTIVE: To test the convergent validity and ease of use of the Unité
Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) scale for patients with
Dupuytren's disease.
METHODS: Patients were prospectively included. We compared the convergent
validity of the URAM scale, the Cochin Hand Function Scale (CHFS) and the
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, in terms of
their correlation with the Tubiana score and self-assessed disability on a visual
analog scale (VAS). Pearson's correlation was used for the convergent validity
study. The response time for questionnaire completion was the outcome for ease of
implementation.
RESULTS: We included 53 patients with Dupuytren's disease in the convergent
validity study and 30 other patients with the disease in the time-response
assessment. The URAM scale showed strong convergence with the Tubiana scale
(r=0.64) and self-assessed disability on a VAS (r=0.69). Convergence with the
Tubiana and self-assessed disability was higher for the URAM scale than the CHFS 
or DASH questionnaire. The mean [SD] response time was shorter for the URAM scale
than the CHFS or DASH questionnaire (42 [20] vs 71 [35] and 103 [59] s,
respectively, P<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results reinforce the psychometric merits of the URAM scale.
Furthermore, the response time for assessing disability was shorter with the URAM
scale than the CHFS or DASH questionnaire. This evidence supports the high
recommendation for the use of the URAM scale in clinical practice and clinical
studies to assess disability in Dupuytren's disease.
