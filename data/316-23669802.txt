Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic condition
that may portend a diagnosis of malignancy. We describe the case of a 73-year-old
man who presented with progressive palmar swelling, erythema, pain, and
contractures of both hands, This presentation and associated weight loss
eventually led to the diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This
case highlights the often delayed, but important diagnosis of this unusual
paraneoplastic phenomenon which can mimic arthropathy, Dupuytren contracture, and
scleroderma. Our case is also the first documentation of the extensive
inflammatory magnetic resonance imaging changes in palmar fasciitis and
polyarthritis syndrome, which affects all tissue planes including the synovium
and explains its confusing clinical manifestations.
