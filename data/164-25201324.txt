BACKGROUND: Up to present no curative treatment is known for Dupuytren's disease 
(DD). Surgery remains the most common treatment but lack of long-term efficacy
and complications limit this therapeutic option.
OBJECTIVE: In a retrospective analysis, the results of radiotherapy with soft
X-rays in the treatment of DD were evaluated.
METHODS: A total of 206 patients (297 affected hands) with DD were included.
Radiation therapy was carried out with soft X-rays. A structured questionnaire
considering patient and disease characteristics and effects of radiotherapy was
evaluated after a median follow-up time of 40 months.
RESULTS: Ninety-three (45%) of the 206 treated patients were reported on a
regression of symptoms after radiation. No further disease progression (including
patients with regression) was present in 165 patients (80%). Satisfaction with
the therapy was expressed with an average score of 7.9 points (visual analogue
scale, 0 = not satisfied, 10 = extremely satisfied). Subjective therapeutic
effects for 426 nodules and/or cords showed a reduction of 92 nodules and/or
cords.
CONCLUSION: In 206 DD patients further disease progression was stopped in most
patients. Radiotherapy proved to be well-tolerated, successful and satisfying for
the patients.
