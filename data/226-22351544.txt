In patients presenting to our unit with recurrent or aggressive Dupuytren's
disease (DD), we favour the technique of radical excision and resurfacing
popularised by Logan, who has described its use for the ulnar two digits of the
hand at the same operation.(1) In patients in whom dermofasciectomy may be
indicated in three or more digits, we have previously advised patients that the
quality of the surgical attention and the post-operative physiotherapy might be
better delivered by a staged approach. However, we demonstrate here with a case
report that the technique can have excellent outcome when used for three digits
at the same time. We are unaware of similar previous reports.
