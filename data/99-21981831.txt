PURPOSE: We undertook a cost-utility analysis to compare traditional fasciectomy 
for Dupuytren with 2 new treatments, needle aponeurotomy and collagenase
injection.
METHODS: We constructed an expected-value decision analysis model with an arm
representing each treatment. A survey was administered to a cohort of 50
consecutive subjects to determine utilities of different interventions. We
conducted multiple sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of varying the rate 
of disease recurrence in each arm of the analysis as well as the cost of the
collagenase injection. The threshold for a cost-effective treatment is based on
the traditional willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life years
(QALY) gained.
RESULTS: The cost of open partial fasciectomy was $820,114 per QALY gained over
no treatment. The cost of needle aponeurotomy was $96,474 per QALY gained versus 
no treatment. When we performed a sensitivity analysis and set the success rate
at 100%, the cost of needle aponeurotomy was $49,631. When needle aponeurotomy
was performed without surgical center or anesthesia costs and with reduced hand
therapy, the cost was $36,570. When a complete collagenase injection series was
priced at $250, the cost was $31,856 per QALY gained. When the injection series
was priced at $945, the cost was $49,995 per QALY gained. At the market price of 
$5,400 per injection, the cost was $166,268 per QALY gained.
CONCLUSIONS: In the current model, open partial fasciectomy is not
cost-effective. Needle aponeurotomy is cost-effective if the success rate is
high. Collagenase injection is cost-effective when priced under $945.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis II.
