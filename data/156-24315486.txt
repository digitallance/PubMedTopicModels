PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of 2 concurrent injections of
collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) in the same hand to treat multiple
Dupuytren flexion contractures.
METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label phase IIIb study, 60 patients received two 
0.58-mg CCH doses injected into cords affecting 2 joints in the same hand during 
1 visit, followed by finger extension approximately 24 hours later. Efficacy at
postinjection day 30 (change in flexion contracture and active range of motion,
patient satisfaction, physician-rated improvement, and rates of clinical success 
[flexion contracture 5° or less]) and adverse events were summarized.
RESULTS: The concurrent injections were most commonly administered in cords
affecting metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints on 
the same finger (47%) or 2 MCP joints on different fingers of the same hand
(37%). Mean total (sum of the 2 treated joints) flexion contracture decreased
76%, from 87° to 24° (MCP joints: 86%; PIP joints: 66%). Mean total range of
motion increased from 100° to 161°. Clinical success was 76% for MCP joints and
33% for PIP joints. Most patients were very satisfied (60%) or quite satisfied
(28%) with treatment. Most investigators rated treated joints as very much
improved (55%) or much improved (37%). The most common treatment-related adverse 
events (> 75% of patients) were contusion, pain in extremity, and edema
peripheral (local edema). Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. 
Serious complications included 1 pulley rupture related to study medication and 1
flexor tendon rupture (following conclusion of the study). There were no systemic
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that 2 affected joints can be effectively and safely
treated with concurrent CCH injections. There was an increased incidence of some 
adverse events with concurrent treatment (pruritus, lymphadenopathy, blood
blister, and skin laceration) compared with treatment of a single joint. High
degrees of patient satisfaction and physician-rated improvement were reported.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
