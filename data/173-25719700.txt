BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease is a benign, progressive, fibroproliferative
disease, and despite advances in basic science and technology, there remains no
cure. To date, open fasciectomy procedures remain the criterion standard for the 
treatment of Dupuytren's disease despite a significant complication rate and
recovery time. Needle aponeurotomy, a less invasive treatment, is associated with
reduced complications and quicker recovery.
METHODS: A literature review and a compilation of over 700 procedures was
performed to highlight the clinical relevance of needle aponeurotomy. A
step-by-step description of the author's technique for needle aponeurotomy is
presented, emphasizing the pearls and pitfalls of the procedure.
RESULTS: Recurrence rates for open fasciectomy are 5 to 10 percent per year
compared with rates for needle aponeurotomy, which are 10 to 20 percent per year.
Overall complication rates are much less frequent with needle aponeurotomy, with 
skin tears being the most common (3 percent). Needle aponeurotomy is cost
effective compared with open fasciectomy. Recurrent proximal interphalangeal
joint flexion contractures remain the most problematic in terms of correction.
CONCLUSIONS: Needle aponeurotomy has been shown to be an extremely useful adjunct
available to the surgeon in the treatment of Dupuytren's disease. This procedure 
can be performed easily in an outpatient setting or office and carries with it
dramatic results. Needle aponeurotomy has a lower complication rate and quicker
recovery when compared with open fasciectomy and is therefore offered to patients
as a first-line treatment.
