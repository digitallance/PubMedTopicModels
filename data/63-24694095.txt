BACKGROUND: The conventional treatment for Dupuytren's disease is surgery. The
introduction of alternative treatment strategies creates a need to track outcomes
and costs relating to surgical treatment and risk factors, such as smoking and
diabetes. This was the aim of the present study.
METHODS: In a prospective study, the outcome of open surgical treatment for
finger flexion contracture in Dupuytren's disease (175 patients; 182 surgical
procedures) was studied by evaluating valid QuickDASH forms answered by subjects 
before surgery and one year postoperatively. Data were also obtained from medical
records, and preoperative declarations concerning health.
RESULTS: In all subjects (median [25% - 75% percentiles] age 68 [62-73]), the
QuickDASH score improved from 22 [9-36] to 5 [0-18]. Smokers (27/179 procedures) 
were younger and had a more severe degree of disease and dysfunction
preoperatively than non-smokers, but the outcome of surgery did not differ
between the groups. Subjects with diabetes (20/181 procedures) were younger than 
those without diabetes, but their disease severity or outcome did not differ.
Hand specialists operated faster than residents, but the surgical outcome did not
differ. Healthcare costs for surgery for Dupuytren's contracture were $ 2392 (€
1859), which were not higher among smokers or subjects with diabetes. Only 22
patients remained in hospital (2 [1-2.3] days) and 28 patients needed sick leave 
(28 [21-31] days). The occurrence of necrosis of skin flaps (12%) or infections
(6%) was no more frequent among smokers or those with diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in surgical outcome for finger flexion
contracture in Dupuytren's disease between smokers and non-smokers or between
subjects with or without diabetes, although smokers had more severe preoperative 
contracture. The costs for surgical treatment for finger flexion contracture in
Dupuytren's disease should be viewed in relation to that for other treatment
strategies.
