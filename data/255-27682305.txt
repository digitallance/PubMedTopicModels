Dupuytren's disease is a connective tissue disorder leading to contractures. It
can be treated surgically or through injections of collagenase Clostridium
histolyticum (CCH). Patients with Dupuytren's contracture (> 20°) and a palpable 
cord were included in this observational study, aiming to characterise the
Belgian patient population and to assess the effectiveness and safety of CCH.
Overall, 108 patients (114 joints) received at least one injection of CCH, and
104 patients completed the study. The percentages of joints achieving a degree of
contracture of 5° or less, or a relative contracture reduction of at least 50%
after the extension procedure were 64.9% and 90.1%, respectively. The mean number
of injections per cord was 1.0. The Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la
Main score decreased from 29.4 ± 11.0 to 12.9 ± 6.3 (mean ± SD ; p < 0.0001). CCH
was demonstrated to be effective, safe and able to increase quality of life.
