Knuckle pads are a rare, frequently overlooked, thickening of the skin usually
overlying the extensor surface of the proximal interphalangeal joints. They are
well- circumscribed, benign lesions that generally do not require treatment.
Idiopathic knuckle pads must be differentiated from similar appearing lesions or 
trauma-induced pseudo-knuckle pads. Knuckle pads have been observed in
association with autosomal dominant conditions such as Bart-Pumphrey syndrome,
Dupuytren's contracture, Ledderhose disease, and Peyronie's disease. To the best 
of our knowledge, idiopathic familial knuckle pads have not previously been
described in the English language literature. We describe a sister and brother
with familial idiopathic knuckle pads with no associated conditions.
