PURPOSE: Increasing options to treat Dupuytren disease include percutaneous
needle fasciotomy (PNF), a minimally invasive technique that has proven to be
effective for the treatment of primary disease. However, its effect on recurrent 
disease is not clear.
METHODS: We studied 30 patients with recurrent Dupuytren disease in 40 fingers,
with a mean follow-up of 4.4 years. Primary outcome measures were total passive
extension deficit reduction and interval to a second recurrence, defined as an
increase of more than 30° compared with the result at the end of the previous
treatment. We noted complications.
RESULTS: Total passive extension reduction was 76%. Percutaneous needle
fasciotomy was especially effective for the metacarpophalangeal joint, with an
average reduction of 93%, whereas the average reduction in the proximal
interphalangeal joint was 57%. A total of 50% of patients did not develop a
secondary recurrence during follow-up. The other 50% did, and we treated
recurrence within an average of 1.4 years after PNF. By means of PNF, we
postponed tertiary treatment an average of 2.9 years starting from the initial
treatment for Dupuytren disease. We successfully treated all secondary
recurrences by limited fasciectomy, according to patients' wishes. We noted no
major adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous needle fasciotomy can be applied effectively for
recurrent disease; 50% of patients remain free of recurrence for a mean of 4.4
years. If a secondary recurrence occurs, it does so relatively early after
treatment. Patients must therefore be willing to accept this uncertainty in the
context of the advantages of PNF, such as fast recovery, low complication rate,
and minimal invasiveness.
