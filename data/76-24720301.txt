Dupuytren contracture is a condition that affects the palmar fascia. It most
commonly affects men of northern European ancestry and initially presents at
middle age. The diseased fascia may form cords that extend into the digits,
resulting in limited motion and function. Treatment is aimed at either releasing 
or removing the diseased cord so that the finger can extend fully. Common
interventions include surgery, needle aponeurotomy, and collagenase injection.
Surgery remains the gold standard in treatment and most commonly includes a
limited fasciectomy. Although often successful, surgery carries inherent risks
and may involve a lengthy recovery with extensive therapy. Needle aponeurotomy
and collagenase injections are office-based alternatives that aim to weaken the
cord and release the contracture. Needle aponeurotomy involves repeated needling 
along the cord in intervals and collagenase injections to dissolve a portion of
the cord. Despite being less invasive, problems such as nerve and/or tendon
injury, skin tears, and autoimmune reactions have been reported. Regardless of
treatment, recurrence remains a concern.
