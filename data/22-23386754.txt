BACKGROUND: Fibromatous nodules in the sole of the foot are often called
Ledderhose disease. It is a benign nodular formation in the plantar aponeurosis, 
typically at the distal medial border. A lump forms and it can be a few
centimeters in diameter. It is frequently seen as an isolated disease, but a
relationship to Dupuytren's has been noted in some patients.
METHODS: The study was a part of a large cohort study, the Reykjavík study. Men
with Dupuytren's disease (n = 122) were invited to follow-up 18 years after the
initial observation. An equal number of controls, matched for age and smoking
habits, were also invited. A total of 92 Dupuytren's patients and 101 control
subjects attended for follow-up and were examined for plantar nodules.
Statistical evaluation was carried out using chi-square test and presented as
odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
RESULTS: Ledderhose disease was identified in 14 of the 92 (15.2%) men with
Dupuytren's disease, while it was only in 4 of the 101 (3.9%) matched controls
(OR = 4.35, 95% CI, 1.3-16.7, P < 0.01). Men operated for Dupuytren's disease or 
with finger contractures were more likely to have plantar nodules than those with
only nodules or strings in the palms (OR = 6.1, 95% CI, 1.8-27.1, P < 0.001). The
plantar involvement was related to family history of Dupuytren's disease (OR =
3.1, 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Men with manifestations of finger contractures or who need surgery
for Dupuytren's disease are more likely to also develop plantar fibromas.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative series.
