To investigate the mechanisms underlying matrix deposition in Dupuytren's
disease, the expression of gelatinase A (MMP-2), the tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), decorin
(DCN), and periostin was studied. The level of relative MMP-2 activation was
investigated using zymography. The mRNA expression of MMP-2, TIMP-2, TGF-β1, and 
DCN was detected using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 
while the presence of protein was detected using immunohistochemical (IHC) and
Western blot techniques. The level of MMP-2 activation was significantly elevated
in tissues with Dupuytren's contracture. RT-PCR demonstrated significantly higher
expression of MMP-2, TIMP-2, TGF-β1, and DCN mRNA in the pathological tissues;
and the IHC and immunoblotting studies revealed elevated expression of TGF-β1,
DCN, and periostin. The balance between MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was disrupted in
patients with Dupuytren's disease. TGF-β1, DCN, and periostin are involved in
extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis in Dupuytren's contracture.
