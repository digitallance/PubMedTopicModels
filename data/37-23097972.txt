INTRODUCTION: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a progressive fibroproliferative
disorder of the hand causing digital flexion contracture. Treatment goals include
removing or releasing the fibrotic cord to allow extension of the affected
finger(s) and restoration of hand function.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In study period from 2001 through 2008, evaluation was
performed in 115 patients. Limited or extensive fasciectomy was performed in all 
patients. Tubiana classification sheme to rate severity of DD was used.
RESULTS: There were 106 male patients ( mean age 62.6 years) and 9 female
patients (mean age 66.3 years). Before the operation, 38% of all patients were at
Tubiana stage I, 32% were at stage II, 22% were at stage III and 8% were at stage
IV. Of all patients, 43% were diagnosed with Dupuytren's in only one finger, 39% 
in two fingers and 18% in three fingers. In 23% of patients DD were diagnosed on 
both hands. Limited fasciectomy was peformed in 90.4% of patients and extensive
fasciectomy in 9.6% of patients. The Tubiana stage achived after surgery was
lower in 98% of patients. As a final result after surgery, 66% of patients didn't
have contracture, stage I was reported in 28% and stage II in 3% of patients.
There were no patients with Tubiana stage III or more after surgery.
Postoperative complications were noted in 18% of patients. Wound healing problems
were present 12% of patients. Haematoma was reported 5% of patients. Of all
patients 22% had diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSION: DD is much more common in male than in female patients. Most of the
patients are diagnosed at Tubiana stage I and II. Surgical correction has led to 
an improvement in most patients. Limited fasciectomy is still the gold-standard
in DD treatment. Extensive fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy is preformed only in
most severe cases.
