BACKGROUND: Dupuytren disease is a fibroproliferative disease of palmar fascia of
the hand. Its prevalence has been the subject of several reviews; however, an
accurate description of the prevalence range in the general population--and of
the relation between age and disease--is lacking.
METHODS: Embase and PubMed were searched using database-specific Medical Subject 
Headings; titles and abstracts were searched for the words "Dupuytren,"
"incidence," and "prevalence." Two reviewers independently assessed the articles 
using inclusion and exclusion criteria, and rated the included studies with a
quality assessment instrument. In a meta-analysis, the median prevalence, as a
function of age by sex, was estimated, accompanied by 95 percent prediction
intervals. The observed heterogeneity in prevalence was investigated with respect
to study quality and geographic location.
RESULTS: Twenty-three of 199 unique identified articles were included. The number
of participants ranged from 37 to 97,537, and age ranged from 18 to 100 years.
Prevalence varied from 0.6 to 31.6 percent. The quality of studies differed but
could not explain the heterogeneity among studies. Mean prevalence was estimated 
as 12, 21, and 29 percent at ages 55, 65, and 75 years, respectively, based on
the relation between age and prevalence determined from 10 studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors describe a prevalence range of Dupuytren disease in the 
general population of Western countries. The relation between age and prevalence 
of Dupuytren disease is given according to sex, including 95 percent prediction
intervals. It is possible to determine disease prevalence at a certain age for
the total population, and for men and women separately.
