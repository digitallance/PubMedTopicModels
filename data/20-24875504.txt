The gold standard treatment for Dupuytren's contracture is surgical excision of
the cord. A non-surgical treatment with collagenase clostridium histolyticum
injection is available but appears costly.OBJECTIVES: To provide data on resource
consumption related to surgical and non-surgical treatment for Dupuytren's
contracture.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients with a single digit Dupuytren's
contracture, 10 treated with surgical excision, and 10 treated with a single
injection of collagenase.
MEASUREMENTS: Minutes spent in theatre, number of follow-up appointments, time to
skin healing, and patients return to normal activities of daily living.
RESULTS: The injection group was significantly better regarding theatre time (p <
0.0001), follow-up appointments (p = 0.048), skin healing time (p < 0.001), and
return to normal activities of daily living (p = 0.02) than the operated group.
CONCLUSIONS: There are significant personal and health economic differences
between the two methods of treatment which may influence local choice.
