To assess the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of 0.58 mg collagenase
Clostridium histolyticum injections for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture 
in Japanese patients, we conducted a phase III, multicentre, uncontrolled,
open-label clinical study in patients with Dupuytren's contracture. Of the 77
patients, 66 achieved clinical success in the primary treated joint (86%; 95%
confidence interval: 76% to 93%), confirming the efficacy of collagenase
Clostridium histolyticum injections. More improvement was seen in the
metacarpophalangeal joints than in the proximal interphalangeal joints (94%
versus 73%). The main adverse reaction was a local reaction in the injected hand.
No tendon rupture or anaphylactic reactions were seen. The concentrations of
collagenase Clostridium histolyticum were below the lower limit of quantification
in plasma samples at all time points. As seen in global studies in Caucasian
patients, a corrective effect on Dupuytren's contracture and good tolerance were 
observed in most non-Caucasian (Asian) Japanese patients.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level
