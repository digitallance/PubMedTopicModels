Morbus Ledderhose is a rare hyperproliferative disease of the plantar fascia,
leading to the formation of nodules. Its origin is unknown. No causal therapy is 
available, and treatment remains symptomatic. Various therapeutic strategies to
alleviate symptoms are available and are adapted to the severity of the disease. 
In early stages, conservative therapy including nonpharmacological, physical, and
pharmacological treatments is applied. If the disease progresses, irradiation of 
the plantar surface, injections of steroids, shock wave therapy, and partial or
complete fasciectomy as an ultimate therapy may be indicated. Novel experimental 
treatment options including application of fibrinolytic agents are currently
being tested, but no controlled, randomized long-term studies are available. This
review aims to provide a systematic overview of current established procedures
and outlines novel experimental strategies for the treatment of morbus
Ledderhose, including future avenues to treat this rare disease.
