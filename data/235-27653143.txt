Dupuytren disease in children younger than 10 years is rare and only 8
histologically proven cases have been reported. A histologically proven Dupuytren
disease in a 10-year-old with an uncommon clinical presentation as a nodule on
the radial side of the middle phalanx of the little finger is documented.
Dupuytren's disease should be in the differential diagnosis in cases of nodules
and contractures in the palm and fingers of children.
