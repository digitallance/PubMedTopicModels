The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of 44
percutaneous needle fasciotomies for Dupuytren's contracture, performed from
March 2005 to June 2010. The mean age of the 36 patients was 58 years and the
mean follow-up period was 28 months. The assessment was based on the clinical
records and clinical evaluation. Pre-operative and postoperative total passive
extension deficit and complications were registered. Recurrence and patient
satisfaction were also noted. The results in stage I and II of Tubiana were
interesting, with an average improvement of more than 70%. For more severe
deformities, the correction obtained was not so satisfactory and decreased
significantly over time. The cumulative rate of minor complications was
significant (11/44) but there were no major complications or permanent sequelae. 
Most of the patients were satisfied with the result and would recommend the
procedure or would be willing to repeat it if necessary. The recurrence rate was 
9%. Percutaneous needle fasciotomy appeared in this study as a minimally
invasive, simple and fast technique with low morbidity. These features make this 
technique a valid alternative in mild stages of Dupuytren's disease.
