OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and safety of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) 
in patients with Dupuytren's contracture (DC) was demonstrated in a program
including two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials (CORD I and II) which included
patients with a broad range of disease severity. This analysis assessed the
efficacy and safety of CCH in the subpopulation of DC patients with up to two
joints affected and moderate disease according to British Society of Surgery of
the Hand classification. This was in support of a resubmission to the Scottish
Medicines Consortium.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A post-hoc analysis that included data from patients
with up to two joints affected and moderate disease treated with CCH during the
randomized and open-label phases of CORD I and II.
RESULTS: Of 362 patients who received CCH during the two trials, 58 had one or
two joints affected and moderate disease. Sixty-seven joints were treated; 49
patients received treatment for one joint, and 9 patients received treatment for 
two joints. Each patient received an average of 1.62 injections of CCH per joint.
Of 65 evaluable joints, 82% met the primary endpoint of clinical success
(reduction in contracture to ≤5° of full extension 30 days after the last
injection). This was similar if only primary joints were considered (81% achieved
clinical success). Recurrence at 12 months (increase in joint contracture to ≥20°
in the presence of a palpable cord in joints that had attained clinical success) 
was observed in 3.8% of joints. Reported adverse events were mild to moderate in 
intensity; none resulted in discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS: CORD I and II show that CCH is well tolerated and effective in the
treatment of DC in a broad population. The present analysis suggests that CCH has
particular value in patients with moderate severity disease and up to two joints 
affected.
STUDY LIMITATIONS: This analysis used data from both the randomized and
open-label phases of CORD I and II; therefore, it is not possible to present
comparative data for this subpopulation. As this was a post-hoc analysis in a
relatively small patient subpopulation, statistical comparisons with the full
population were not considered appropriate. Furthermore, the small sample size
means that additional subgroup analyses, for example of patients by previous
treatment or number of injections administered, are not appropriate.
Nevertheless, the data presented demonstrate that CCH is both well tolerated and 
effective in this population when managed by appropriately trained individuals.
