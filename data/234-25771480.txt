PURPOSE: To test the effectiveness of static and dynamic orthoses using them as
an exclusive treatment for proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint flexion
contracture compared with other hand therapy conservative treatments described in
the literature.
METHODS: 60 patients who used orthoses were compared with a control group that
received other hand therapy treatments. Clinical assessments were measured before
the experiment and 3 months after and included active PIP joint extension and
function.
RESULTS: A significant improvement in the extension active range of motion at the
PIP joint in the second measurement was found in both groups, but it was
significantly greater in the experimental group. Improvement in function
(Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score) between the first and second 
assessment was similar in the control and experimental groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Using night progressive static and daily dynamic orthoses as an
exclusive treatment during the proliferative phase led to significant
improvements in the PIP joint active extension, but the improvement did not
correlate with increased function as perceived by the patient.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic I.
