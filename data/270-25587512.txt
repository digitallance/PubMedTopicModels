BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease encompasses a spectrum of fibroblastic disorders 
from the presence of 1-2 nodules in the palm of a hand with no joint contracture 
to grotesque, crippling and disabling deformities of hands. Over the last 50
years, many enlightening studies have been forthcoming, which, through techniques
of histopathology, biochemistry, tissue culture, and electron microscopy, have
shed pearls of light on various aspects of the disease process.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature on Dupuytren's disease was
undertaken, stringing together results from numerous studies to establish a table
of events and their location in the development of the disease.
RESULTS: What will be seen is a credible scenario of events which will enable the
clinician to be more proactive in the earlier treatment of the disease and more
aware of factors that increase or decrease recurrence rates postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The most effective management of Dupuytren's disease is early
recognition and treatment of the nodule, before the development of a joint
contracture, particularly of a proximal interphalangeal joint. As there is
evidence of a significant inflammatory role in the development of the nodule, the
process of fibroplasia can be minimized by altering the macrophage > fibroblast >
collagen cascade by the intralesional injection of a potent anti-inflammatory
agent such as triamcinolone, which also blocks tissue inhibitors of collagenase, 
thus enhancing the action of native collagenase, and reduces the size and
firmness of nodules and, at least temporarily, arrests their progression.
