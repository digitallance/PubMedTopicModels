Treatment of stages IIIIV of the Dupuytrens Disease using a personal approach:
percutaneous needle fasciotomy (PNF) and minimal invasive selective
aponeurectomy.

Corradino B, Di Lorenzo S, Moschella F.

The authors present their experience in treating 23 fingers on 20 patients
affected by Dupuytrens Disease in stages III and IV of the Tubiana classification
with their personal technique that involves the percutaneous needle fasciotomy
followed 40 days after by a selective open aponeurectomy on the previously
treated cord, by making a small cutaneous incision. The treatment requires
careful selection of the patients. In fact, patients suffering from the disease
for more than 5 years and all the cases with a suspicion of joint rigidity are
excluded from the study. The average follow up period was approximately 48
months. 18 out of the 20 patients had excellent functional recovery. Skin grafts 
or local flaps are not required after selective aponeurectomy with these surgical
steps. The advantages of this technique include its simplicity, minimal
discomfort to patients, rapid functional recovery, low recurrence rate and low
cost.
