BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to identify postoperative results and
complications using a percutaneous approach to treat Dupuytren's contracture in a
consecutive series of patients.
METHODS: A review of all patients with Dupuytren's contracture treated with
percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (NA) from 2008 to 2010 was performed. Patient
demographics, digits affected, and disease severity was recorded. Pre-operative
total passive extension deficit (TPED) was calculated for each affected digit.
TPED in the immediate postoperative period and at the time of most recent
follow-up was measured. Treatment-related complications and incidence of disease 
recurrence were identified. Statistical analysis was performed using paired
t-test. (Statistical significance p-value <0.05).
RESULTS: 525 digits in 193 hands were treated with NA. 140 patients were male,
average age was 65 years. The average preoperative TPED was 41° and the average
immediate postoperative TPED was 1° (98% correction) (P=0.0001). The average TPED
at 4.5 month follow up was 11 o (73% correction). Complications included
infection in 3 patients and one case each of triggering, delayed flexor tendon
rupture, complex regional pain syndrome and persistent numbness. Recurrence was
observed in 62 digits.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy is an effective technique in the
treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Near complete correction of contracture was
achieved and few complications were observed. Longer follow-up is needed to
determine if these short-term results are maintained.
