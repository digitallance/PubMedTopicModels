Injectable collagenase is an alternative to surgical treatment for Dupuytren's
disease. Previous studies have reported on the effectiveness of collagenase in
finger contractures. This prospective study reports on the short-term safety and 
efficacy of collagenase treatment in five thumb and first web space Dupuytren's
contractures. The thumb and first web space contractures were treated with
injectable collagenase in four consecutive patients (five hands) with experience 
of previous surgical digital fasciectomy. The thumb contracture was measured by
angle and span in two planes of thumb extension and abduction before injection
and after manipulation. Collagenase treatment resulted in release of the
contracture with a mean increase in thumb to index angle from 23° (10° to 35°) to
56° (45° to 60°) in extension and from 30° (10° to 50°) to 58° (50° to 65°) in
abduction and a mean increase in span from 1.9 cm (1 to 3.5) to 3.9 cm (3 to 5)
in extension and from 2.4 cm (1.5 to 3.5) to 3.9 cm (3 to 4.5) in abduction. All 
patients reported an increased range of movement and function and described
collagenase therapy as preferable to surgery. In the short-term collagenase is an
effective, well-tolerated and safe alternative to surgery for Dupuytren's disease
of the thumb.
