BACKGROUND: Plantar fibromatosis is a benign disease creating nodules on the
medial plantar side of affected patients. While surgical removal is regarded as
the therapeutic mainstay, recurrence rates and impairment of daily activities
remains substantial. High-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave therapy has
been suggested to be potentially effective in plantar fibromatosis in terms of
pain reduction.
HYPOTHESIS: High-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces pain in
plantar fibromatosis.
FINDINGS: A total number of six patients (5 males, 58±4 years) were included with
plantar fibromatosis (Ledderhose's disease) associated with pain. Three patients 
were operated on previously, one had concomitant Dupuytren's contracture.
High-energy focussed ESWT was applied using a Storz Duolith SD1 (2000 impulses, 3
Hz, 1.24 mJ/mm²) in two sessions with 7 days between. Pain was 6±2 at baseline,
2±1 after 14 days and 1±1 after 3 months. Softening of the nodules was noted by
all patients. No adverse effects were noted.
CONCLUSIONS: High-energy focussed extracorporeal shockwave energy reduces pain in
painful plantar fibromatosis (Morbus Ledderhose). Further large-scale prospective
trials are warranted to elucidate the value of high-energy focussed
extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) in plantar fibromatosis in terms of
recurrence and efficacy.
