For good performance in clinical and forensic toxicology, it is important to be
aware of the signs and symptoms related to xenobiotic exposure since they will
assist clinicians to reach a useful and rapid diagnosis. This manuscript
highlights and critically analyses clinical and forensic imaging related to
ethanol abuse. Here, signs that may lead to suspected ethanol abuse, but that are
not necessarily related to liver disease are thoroughly discussed regarding its
underlying mechanisms. This includes flushing and disulfiram reactions,
urticaria, palmar erythema, spider telangiectasias, porphyria cutanea tarda,
"paper money skin", psoriasis, rhinophyma, Dupuytren's contracture, multiple
symmetrical lipomatosis (lipomatosis Lanois-Bensaude, Madelung's disease),
pancreatitis-related signs, black hairy tongue, gout, nail changes, fetal alcohol
syndrome, seborrheic dermatitis, sialosis and cancer.
