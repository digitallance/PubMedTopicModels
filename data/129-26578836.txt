Dupuytren's disease with severe finger contractures and recurrent contractures
following previous surgery often have extensive skin involvement. In these severe
cases, excision of the diseased chord along with the involved skin is a good
option to reduce the risk of recurrance. The resulting skin defect can be covered
with a full thickness skin graft (FTSG) or a cross finger flap. Cross finger
flaps have donor finger morbidity and hence a full thickness graft is usually
preferred. The FTSG extending to the midlateral margins on both sides of the
finger reduces the risk of joint contracture due to graft shrinkage. Once the
FTSG is sutured in place, the standard practice is to compress and secure the
graft to its recipient bed with a tie-over dressing and this can be time
consuming. We present a simple dressing technique to secure the FTSG without the 
need for a tie-over dressing.
