PURPOSE: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of collagenase
Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) in the United States in February 2010. This study 
addresses the impact of that approval on the number of Dupuytren contracture (DC)
encounters and treatment patterns in the United States.
METHODS: Using the Intercontinental Marketing Services Health Office-Based
Medical Claims database, we identified the monthly number of DC encounters and DC
procedures between January 2007 and December 2013. Collagenase Clostridium
histolyticum usage data from March 2010 to December 2013 was derived from the
U.S. CCH manufacturer's data warehouse. Using the combined data, the yearly
increasing trends in DC encounters and treatment volume were compared before and 
after the introduction of CCH. Time trends in the relative procedure frequencies 
were then examined. Finally, the presence of seasonal variation was tested for in
each treatment type.
RESULTS: Dupuytren contracture encounters increased on average by 19,015 per year
between 2007 and 2009, whereas between 2011 and 2013, DC encounters increased on 
average by 34,940 per year. In terms of absolute procedure counts, the surgery
trend line began decreasing in 2010 with the release of CCH. Meanwhile, CCH
continuously increased between 2010 and 2013, and needle aponeurotomy (NA)
remained relatively stable. By the year 2013, minimally invasive techniques (NA
and CCH) comprised 39% of all treatment, compared with only 14% in 2007. Lastly, 
there was a statistically significant seasonal increase in the number of surgical
procedures during the wintertime but no seasonal variation in NA or CCH.
CONCLUSIONS: After the introduction of CCH, the number of Dupuytren encounters
increased at a greater annual rate. The introduction and growth of CCH coincided 
with a decrease in surgery. The number of NA procedures remained steady
throughout the study period. The number of open surgery cases followed a
predictable seasonal variation with more procedures during the winter months, but
this seasonal variation was not seen with less invasive techniques.
