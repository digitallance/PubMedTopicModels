Incorporating evidence-based medicine into practice is now an expectation for
hand surgeons. Hand surgeons need to be able to assess associated benefits,
risks, cost, and applicability of a treatment option when providing care to their
patients. Using a clinical example, this article takes the reader through the
three-step approach when using a publication from the medical literature on
therapy. The focus of this article is primarily the second and third steps, which
involve measuring and understanding treatment effectiveness.
