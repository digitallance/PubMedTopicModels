BACKGROUND: Dupuytren disease affects fingers in a variable fashion. Knowledge
about specific disease patterns (phenotype) based on location and severity of the
disease is lacking.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 344 primary affected hands with Dupuytren
disease were physically examined. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the
coexistence of Dupuytren disease in pairs of fingers was calculated, and
agglomerative hierarchical clustering was applied to identify possible clusters
of affected fingers. With a multivariate ordinal logit model, the authors studied
the correlation on severity, taking into account age and sex, and tested
hypotheses on independence between groups of fingers.
RESULTS: The ring finger was most frequently affected by Dupuytren disease, and
contractures were seen in 15.1 percent of affected rays. The severity of thumb
and index finger, middle and ring fingers, and middle and little fingers was
significantly correlated. Occurrences in pairs of fingers were highest in the
middle and ring fingers and lowest in the thumb and index finger. Correlation
between the ring and little fingers and a correlation between fingers from the
ulnar and radial sides could not be demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: Rays on the ulnar side of the hand are predominantly affected. The
middle finger is substantially correlated with other fingers on the ulnar side,
and the thumb and index finger are correlated; however, there was no evidence
that the ulnar side and the radial side were correlated in any way, which
suggests that occurrence on one side of the hand does not predict Dupuytren
disease on the other side of the hand.
