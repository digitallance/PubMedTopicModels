Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia with
various complications including diabetic hand syndrome (DHS); a condition
characterized by association of distinct entities; limited joint mobility (LJM), 
Dupuytren's disease (DD), flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) and carpal tunnel syndrome
(CTS) resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was
to evaluate the prevalence of these changes and their association to diabetes
duration. We studied 142 type 2 and 45 type 1 DM patients and investigated the
presence of these hand changes and peripheral neuropathy (PNP). The prevalence of
LJM was 29.4%, DD was 17.6%, FTS was 10.7% and CTS 41.7% in all diabetics. The
prevalence of CTS was more in type 2 DM (83.3%) as compared to type 1 DM (24.4%).
Age and duration of diabetes were clearly related to these changes. A clear
association between these changes and PNP was observed. The prevalence of CTS and
hand changes was higher in type 2 diabetics. The association of DD and PNP
suggests that common factors could contribute to their pathogenesis.
Consequently, clinical examination for diabetic hand should not ignore it.
