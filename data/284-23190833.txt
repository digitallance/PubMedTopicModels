BACKGROUND: Application of platelet concentrates to wounds could speed healing.
Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin, a relatively recent development, stands out 
from the other preparations. This prospective, randomized, controlled clinical
trial studied the rate of healing of postoperative hand wounds after a single
application of leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin.
METHODS: Eligible patients were healthy individuals older than 18 years who had
been scheduled for elective McCash (open palm) surgery for Dupuytren disease at
the Plastic and Hand Surgery Department of Nice's University Hospital between
August of 2007 and February of 2010. The control group received the reference
care of petroleum jelly mesh (Vaselitulle), and test patients had leukocyte- and 
platelet-rich fibrin applied. The primary endpoint was healing delay measured in 
postoperative days. Secondary endpoints included pain, bleeding, and wound
exudate. The trial was carried out as a single-blind trial.
RESULTS: Among the 68 randomized patients, 33 patients in the leukocyte- and
platelet-rich fibrin group and 31 in the Vaselitulle group were analyzed. Primary
endpoint analysis showed a median healing delay of 24 days (interquartile range, 
18 to 28 days) for the fibrin group and 29 days (interquartile range, 26 to 35
days) for the Vaselitulle group (p = 0.014, log-rank test). Postoperative pain
assessment, bleeding, and exudate were always lower for the fibrin group, but not
significantly so.
CONCLUSION: The authors trial demonstrates that a single leukocyte- and
platelet-rich fibrin application on fresh postoperative hand wounds shows a
median improvement of 5 days in comparison with the standard treatment.
