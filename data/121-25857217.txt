OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost of switching surgical aponeurectomy to percutaneous
needle aponeurotomy in one-ray Dupuytren's disease.
METHODS: A model analysis was performed with a cross-sectional national survey of
public and private French hospitals in 2012. All stays for one-ray aponeurectomy 
were "virtually" replaced with 1, 2 or 3 outpatient sessions of percutaneous
needle aponeurotomy. The costs were based on the hospital cost (tariff per
disease-related group) and on common classification of medical procedures
performed in outpatient care for 2013.
RESULTS: Dupuytren's disease represented 18,707 hospitalizations (€26 million
[2013 euros]) in France in 2012, 8534 hospitalizations for one-ray aponeurectomy 
(€11.9 million). By replacing surgical aponeurectomy with percutaneous needle
aponeurotomy for one-ray Dupuytren's disease, 91% to 97% and 56% to 59% of the
treatment costs could be saved using hospitalizations for one-ray aponeurectomy
or total hospital costs, respectively, as reference.
CONCLUSIONS: Replacing aponeurectomy with percutaneous needle aponeurotomy for
one-ray Dupuytren's disease could greatly reduce the treatment costs for all
Dupuytren's disease. Effective alternatives to surgery for Dupuytren's disease,
such as needle aponeurotomy in an outpatient setting should be considered in the 
economic perspective.
