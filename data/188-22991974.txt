OBJECTIVES: To explore the human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 allele frequency in
Dupuytren's disease (DD).
METHOD: HLA-DRB1 genotypes were analysed by sequence-specific primers (SSPs) in
samples collected from 172 men participating in a nested case-control study on
the clinical manifestations and progression of DD. Of those, 121 had signs of DD 
while 51 did not. Of the 121 men with DD, 49 had contracted fingers or had been
operated on, while 72 had nodules or fibrous cords in the palms. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CIs) were used to evaluate the results.
RESULTS: The HLA-DRB1*01 allele was observed in 26 of the 121 affected men
(23.7%) but in only four of the controls (7.8%) (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.06-9.75). The 
HLA-DRB1*01 allele frequency in those affected was 11%, while in the control
group it was 4% (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.05-9.03).
CONCLUSIONS: This observation indicates a possible association of HLA-DRB1*01
with DD, but further studies are needed for confirmation.
