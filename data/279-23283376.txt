BACKGROUND: Upper-extremity-specific disability correlates with mood and coping
strategies. The aim of this study was to determine if two psychological factors, 
kinesiophobia (fear of movement) and perceived partner support, contribute
significantly to variation in upper-extremity-specific disability in a model that
included factors known to contribute to variation such as depression, pain
anxiety, and catastrophic thinking.
METHODS: We performed an observational cross-sectional study of 319 patients who 
each had one of the following conditions: trigger finger (n = 94), carpal tunnel 
syndrome (n = 29), trapeziometacarpal arthrosis (n = 33), Dupuytren contracture
(n = 31), de Quervain syndrome (n = 28), wrist ganglion cyst (n = 32), lateral
epicondylosis (n = 41), and a fracture of the distal part of the radius treated
nonoperatively six weeks previously (n = 31). Each patient completed the
Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and
questionnaires measuring symptoms of depression, pain anxiety, catastrophic
thinking, kinesiophobia, and perceived level of support from a partner or
significant other. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to determine
significant independent predictors of the DASH score.
RESULTS: Men had significantly lower (better) DASH scores than women (21 versus
31; p < 0.01). DASH scores also differed significantly by diagnosis (p < 0.01),
marital status (p = 0.047), and employment status (p < 0.01). The DASH score
correlated significantly with depressive symptoms (p < 0.01), catastrophic
thinking (p < 0.01), kinesiophobia (p < 0.01), and pain anxiety (p < 0.01) but
not with perceived partner support. The best multivariable model of factors
associated with greater arm-specific disability (according to the DASH score)
included sex, diagnosis, employment status, catastrophic thinking, and
kinesiophobia and accounted for 55% of the variation.
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, kinesiophobia and catastrophic thinking were the
most important predictors of upper-extremity-specific disability in a model that 
accounted for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and pathophysiology (diagnosis)
and explained more than half of the variation in disability. Perceived partner
support was not a significant factor. The consistent and predominant role of
several modifiable psychological factors in disability suggests that patients may
benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that optimizes mindset and coping
strategies.
