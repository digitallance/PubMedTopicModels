Patients awaiting surgery for Dupuytren's contractures listed the problems from
their Dupuytren's disease that had led them to request surgery and their relative
priorities of the results of surgery. The listed problems were compared with the 
nine items comprising the Unité Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM)
Dupuytren's disease-specific outcome measure. One hundred and ten patients
reported 278 problems. Ninety-four different combinations of problems were
provided by patients, and over half (55%) of the problems were not captured by
items in the URAM scale. The long-term outcome from surgery was relatively more
important to patients than speed of recovery. The URAM tool may not be relevant
to patients in the UK, and further assessment of its face validity is required
before it is used.
