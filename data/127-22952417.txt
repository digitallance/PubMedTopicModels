BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and HFE hemochromatosis occur in some of
the same at-risk populations and present with similar comorbid conditions.
METHODS: We estimated DC prevalence in two cohorts of white Alabama
hemochromatosis probands (294 C282Y homozygotes, 67 C282Y/H63D compound
heterozygotes) in a retrospective study. We performed logistic regressions on DC 
using the following independent variables: age, body mass index, heavy ethanol
consumption, serum ferritin, elevated serum AST/ALT, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and diabetes.
RESULTS: One man and two women with C282Y homozygosity had DC (prevalence 1.02%; 
95% CI 0.35%-2.96%). A man with C282Y/H63D had DC (prevalence 1.49%; 95% CI
0.26%-7.98%). DC occurred as an autosomal dominant trait in his kinship. In
regression analyses, no single variable predicted DC. We observed no new DC cases
after the diagnosis of hemochromatosis (mean follow-up 12.9 ± 7.5 years (1 SD),
and 9.0 ± 5.1 years, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Our prevalence estimates of DC in white Alabama hemochromatosis
probands are similar to those found in the white US population cohorts. DC risk
was unrelated to the variables we studied.
