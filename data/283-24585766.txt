Arthur Rainsford Mowlem, the junior of the 'big four' plastic surgeons, with
Harold Delf Gillies, Thomas Pomfret Kilner and Archibald Hector McIndoe, came to 
prominence managing casualties of the Second World War. Rainsford Mowlem's
ancestor was John Mowlem, the creator of the construction firm. Rainsford worked 
his passage to the United Kingdom from New Zealand in 1927 and did not return to 
New Zealand but retired at the age of 60 to enjoy 23 more years in Spain. He was 
the driving force between 1934 and 1939 at the Plastic Surgery Unit at St James's
Hospital, Balham, and instigated the North London Plastic Surgery Unit at Hill
End, St Albans, from 1939 to 1953 and subsequently developed the Unit after
moving to Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex. After successfully hosting
the International Meeting of Plastic Surgeons in London in 1959, he received
recognition and honours in America but soon afterwards he surprised colleagues by
retiring in 1962. Despite his significant contributions, he did not receive
national honours but his life outside surgery was active including Trusteeship of
the Mowlem Estate at Swanage in Dorset for 40 years.
