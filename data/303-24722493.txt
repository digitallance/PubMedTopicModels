OBJECTIVE: The development of periarticular thickening of skin on the hands and
limited joint mobility (cheiroarthropathy) is associated with diabetes and can
lead to significant disability. The objective of this study was to describe the
prevalence of cheiroarthropathy in the well-characterized Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications
(DCCT/EDIC) cohort and examine associated risk factors, microvascular
complications, and the effect of former DCCT therapy (intensive [INT] vs.
conventional [CONV]) on its development.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis was performed in 1,217
participants (95% of the active cohort) in EDIC years 18/19 after an average of
24 years of follow-up. Cheiroarthropathy-defined as the presence of any one of
the following: adhesive capsulitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, flexor tenosynovitis,
Dupuytren's contracture, or a positive prayer sign-was assessed using a targeted 
medical history and standardized physical examination. A self-administered
questionnaire (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH]) assessed
functional disability.
RESULTS: Cheiroarthropathy was present in 66% of subjects (64% of the INT group
and 68% of the CONV group; P = 0.1640) and was associated with age, sex, diabetes
duration, skin intrinsic fluorescence, HbA1c, neuropathy, and retinopathy (P <
0.005 for each). DASH functional disability scores were worse among subjects with
cheiroarthropathy (P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Cheiroarthropathy is common in people with type 1 diabetes of long
duration (∼30 years) and is related to longer duration and higher levels of
glycemia. Clinicians should include cheiroarthropathy in their routine history
and physical examination of patients with type 1 diabetes because it causes
clinically significant functional disability.
