Using a case study approach, 2 disorders of the hands are presented. Dupuytren's 
contractures and bilateral trigger finger are described with a discussion of the 
interventions, including injection and surgical repair. Dupuytren's disease is a 
contracture of the connective tissue in the hand. It is also known as palmar
fibromatosis and can occur bilaterally. This is a progressive disorder and causes
deformity of the hands and eventually results in a decrease of functionality.
Trigger finger is a common finger ailment that also causes deformity of the hand.
This disorder is often referred to as stenosing tenosynovitis and can occur in
several fingers bilaterally. The inflammation and hypertrophy of the sheath
restricts the motion of the flexor tendon that results in triggering of the
affected finger. It is painful and disabling. The etiology, prevalence,
incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and nursing care of these disorders are
discussed.
