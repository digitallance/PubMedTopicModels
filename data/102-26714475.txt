INTRODUCTION: In operative treatment of Dupuytren's disease, in certain cases
proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) flexion contracture remains after
fasciectomy which can be corrected by a supplementary arthrolysis, but few data
comparing primary and revision surgery are available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients who had a fasciectomy and supplementary
PIP arthrolysis at the affected finger for the first time were compared to 13
patients who had a revision fasciectomy with a supplementary PIP arthrolysis.
Upon follow-up at 22 months, flexion contracture was measured and data were
compared to the preoperative values. Patient satisfaction with the outcome of the
operation was determined and patients completed the Disabilities of the Arm,
Shoulder and Hand outcome measure questionnaire.
RESULTS: Fingers of patients with Dupuytren's disease that had a partial
fasciectomy and supplementary arthrolysis of the PIP for the first time had a
median residual PIP flexion contracture of 30° compared 39° of fingers that had a
partial fasciectomy and supplementary arthrolysis of the PIP as a revision. The
patients of both groups were equally satisfied with the outcome of the operation,
while their DASH scores were nearly identical.
CONCLUSION: After a mean follow-up of 2 years, the outcome of recurrent PIP
contracture is comparable in patients with Dupuytren's disease that were treated 
by partial fasciectomy and supplementary arthrolysis for the first time and as a 
revision.
