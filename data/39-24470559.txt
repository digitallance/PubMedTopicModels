In POINT X, a study designed to reflect clinical practice and patient treatment
choices, 254 European patients received open-label collagenase for Dupuytren's
contracture. The most severely affected joint was treated first in 74% of
patients. In total, 52%, 41%, 7%, and 1% of patients selected the little, ring,
middle, and index finger, respectively; 79% had one or two joints treated. Only
9% of patients (n = 24) received 4 or 5 injections. The mean improvement in total
passive extension deficit (TPED) was 34° on day 1, improving further by day 7 to 
42°. This secondary improvement was maintained by day 90 and month 6. The mean
number of injections/joint was 1.2 for the metacarpophalangeal joint and 1.25 for
the proximal interphalangeal joint. Median time to recovery was 4 days; the mean 
improvement in hand function was clinically relevant as measured by the Unité
Rhumatologique des Affections de la Main (URAM) score. In total, 87% and 86% of
patients and physicians, respectively, were very satisfied or satisfied with
treatment at month 6, although correlation between TPED and patient satisfaction 
was weak (Spearman -0.18, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.06). Collagenase was well tolerated,
with 10 (3.9%) patients experiencing severe adverse events. As a real-world
study, the POINT X findings can be generalized to the at-large population.
