Similar Distributions of Dupuytren's Contracture and Y-Chromosome Haplogroup I
Among Modern Europeans Suggest Simultaneous Spreading of These Traits Some 40 to 
10 KYA.

Kurbel S, Samarzija Z.

A proposition is made that when two independent traits show similar regional
patterns of incidence among modern European regions, a plausible expectation is
that these two, otherwise unrelated traits, have simultaneously been spread by
migration of our ancestors. As a potential example for the proposed concept,
distribution of patients with Dupuytren's contracture is here compared with the
reported European distribution of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup I, a genetic marker
linked to the last glaciation period.
