Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) is a heterogeneous group of muscular
dystrophies that mostly affect the pelvic and shoulder girdle muscle groups. We
report here a case of neuromuscular disease associated with Dupuytren's
contracture, which has never been described before as cosegregating with an
autosomal dominant type of inheritance. Dupuytren's contracture is a common
disease, especially in Northern Europe. Comorbid conditions associated with
Dupuytren's contracture are repetitive trauma to the hands, diabetes, and
seizures, but it has never before been associated with neuromuscular disease. We 
hypothesize that patients may harbor mutations in genes with functions related to
neuromuscular disease and Dupuytren's contracture development.
