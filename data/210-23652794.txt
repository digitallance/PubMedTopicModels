Myofibroblasts (MFs) are responsible for both physiological wound and scar
contraction. However, it is not known whether these cells act individually to
contract the surrounding matrix or whether they behave in a coordinated manner.
Therefore, we studied intercellular junctions of primary human MFs derived from
patients with Dupuytren's disease, a fibrotic disorder of the dermis and
subdermal tissues of the palm. The cells were maintained in anchored
three-dimensional collagen lattices to closely mimic conditions in vivo. We found
that selective blockade of adherens, mechanosensitive, or gap junctions
effectively inhibited contraction of the collagen matrices and downregulated the 
MF phenotype. Our data indicate that MFs in part function as a coordinated
cellular syncytium, and disruption of intercellular communication may provide a
therapeutic target in diseases characterized by an overabundance of these
contractile cells.
