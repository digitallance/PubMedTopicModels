PURPOSE: To study the results of using a small, headless compression screw
(AcuTwist) for thumb interphalangeal (IP) joint and finger distal interphalangeal
(DIP) joint arthrodeses.
METHODS: Between November 2007 and January 2012, 48 primary arthrodeses of the
thumb IP joint or DIP joint in the other digits were performed in 29 consecutive 
patients with AcuTwist devices. Indications for arthrodesis included 19 cases of 
osteoarthritis in 25 fingers, 3 cases of lupus in 9 fingers, 2 cases of
post-traumatic osteoarthritis in 2 fingers, and 1 case and finger each of acute
trauma, neuromuscular disorder, postinfectious osteoarthritis, boutonniere
deformity, and Dupuytren contracture. Charts were reviewed for clinical data, and
radiographs were assessed for alignment and healing.
RESULTS: Age averaged 59 years and follow-up averaged 12 months (range, 2-50 mo).
Union occurred in 43 out of 46 fingers (94%). There were no cases of nail
deformity, wound complications, tip hypersensitivity, or clinically notable
malalignment. Three arthrodeses failed to fuse, including 2 asymptomatic
nonunions and 1 fixation loss requiring revision with autograft. The complication
rate was 9%.
CONCLUSIONS: Distal digital joint arthrodesis with the AcuTwist resulted in a
fusion rate of 94% with a complication rate of 9%. Our rate of fusion compares
favorably with prior series using other methods of fixation.
TYPE OF STUDY/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic IV.
