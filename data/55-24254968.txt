BACKGROUND: Dupuytren's disease (DD) is a fibroproliferative pathology that
affects the palmar aponeurosis causing the development of nodules and collagen
cords and the progressive flexion of the fingers. The standard procedure is
surgical fasciectomy, followed by high recurrence rates. Collagenase Clostridium 
histolyticum (CCH) injection represents an innovative noninvasive approach to the
treatment of DD. This prospective study was designed to examine the efficacy and 
safety of CCH injection performed in the outpatient, using local anesthesia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients [32 metacarpophalangeal (MP), 8 proximal
interphalangeal (PIP)] with Dupuytren's contracture of at least 20° for MP joint 
and any degree for PIP joint were included. The mean age was 66. All joints were 
treated with a single vial of collagenase injection and manual breaking of the
cord 24 h after. All adverse effects (AEs) were monitored. Patients were checked 
7, 30, 90, and 180 days after the injection. Primary endpoint was a reduction in 
digit contracture within 0°-5° of normal extension. Secondary endpoints were the 
improvement of range of motion, the evaluation of AEs incidence, and
cost-effectiveness of collagenase treatment.
RESULTS: About 67.5 % of patients obtained a clinical success. At 6 months, a
further 7.5% attained the same result. The mean contracture of treated joints was
5.3º for MP and 6.8° for PIP joints. Twenty-three patients had one or more
mild-to-moderate side effects.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of collagenase appears to be an effective and safe method
for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture. Therapeutic success was achieved in
a significant percentage of patients. The incidence of side effects was higher,
but they were local reactions of short duration. The use of a single collagenase 
vial in patients treated in day surgery appears more cost-effective than surgery.
