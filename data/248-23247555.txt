Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic systemic disease with a wide range of
complications, including complications in the musculoskeletal system. DM is a
common disease in nearly all countries and continues to increase in numbers and
significance. Approximately 90 % of patients have type 2 DM which is caused by
resistance to insulin. Type 1 DM results from an absolute deficiency of insulin
due to an autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells within the
pancreas. Diabetic patients suffer from diverse rheumatic conditions that affect 
their life quality. This article reviews the rheumatic conditions that are
associated with DM and the pathophysiologic relationships that might link these
conditions; it also summarizes recent advances in the field of diabetes and
rheumatic conditions. The rheumatic conditions that are discussed in this review 
include limited joint mobility, Dupuytren's contracture, flexor tenosynovitis,
carpal tunnel syndrome, adhesive capsulitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal
hyperostosis, neuropathic osteoarthropathy, diabetic muscle infarction, crystal
induced arthritis, osteoarthritis, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
